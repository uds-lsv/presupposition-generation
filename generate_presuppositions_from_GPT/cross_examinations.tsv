Dr. Radetsky, would it be fair to say, sir, that you are no stranger to the courtroom?
A. I have probably given courtroom testimony around 50 times, Mr. Fox.
Q. And you are no stranger to the legal process, are you, sir?
A. I’m not quite sure I understand your question.
Q. Well, having given in excess of 400 depositions, you understand parts of the legal process, you understand why depositions are taken and so forth?
A. Well, I — to the best of my ability, I understand from my point of view, sir.
Q. Well, what I’m trying to get at is you said it was 50 two years ago, and we are now at two years later, and we know you’ve testified in court at least seven or eight times over the last two years, correct?
A. Well, I don’t recall saying that I testified 50 times a couple of years ago, but, again, since I don’t really keep a running total, sir, what I try to do is kind of have an order of magnitude. I know it’s not ten, and I know it’s not a hundred, so it’s probably in the
middle range.
Q. Well, Doctor, can we agree that, in any event, that a substantial amount of your professional time is devoted to dealing with lawyers?
A. No. My professional time is spent being a doctor. I do do this work, sir, but I really do it mostly on my own time. I get up at four in the morning if I have to. I’ll work on weekends, or I’ll work when my kids are in bed. On days like today, I do have to take off time from work and time from my family to come here, but I’m a full-time doctor.
[Note the witness’s carefully planned zinger, trying to establish himself as a “one of us” family man and full-time doctor. But the cross-examiner is ready for this.]
Q. Doctor, it is very misleading to tell this jury that your legal work is done at four in the morning and on weekends, isn’t it, sir? Isn’t that just a little misleading?
A. No, I don’t think so, Mr. Fox. That’s actually when I do do the work, because during the middle part of the day I’m either at the hospital consulting with doctors, visiting my hospice patients in the nursing homes or wherever, so my days are pretty well filled. The weekends are freer, and I do work on the weekends.
Q. Well, I’ve got — I don’t have all 400 of your depositions here, but I’ve got about 80, and I would be happy to go through them if the need arises. But I would represent to you, sir, that in all 80 of these depositions, not a single one was taken at 4:00 a.m. or on the weekends. Every single one was taken on a weekday between nine and five. Could you accept that possibility, sir, or should we walk through them?
A. Well, then I’m confused, sir. The major work in a case like this really is going through the records, going through the depositions. That actually takes a quite a long time. I do give depositions during the middle of the day, so I take off time from work to do
that. And, obviously, I’m here during the weekday so I’m not back at my practice in New Mexico. But the bulk of the work is paperwork and research work and going on the Internet and that sort of thing, and that really is done on my own time.
Q. Doctor, I’m not arguing whether it’s done on your own time or not. I’m simply saying that it would be misleading to tell this jury that the legal work that you do is done at 4:00 a.m. and on weekends when we know that a good part of it is done Monday through Friday between nine and five.
A. The depositions are given during the daytime, but I don’t think the jury is misled, sir.
Q. And, in fact, Doctor, the answer you just gave us, about you doing legal work at 4:00 a.m. and on the weekends, that’s an answer that you give quite frequently, isn’t it, sir?
A. Happens to be the true answer.
Q. And when you were in Jacksonville last year –do you remember going to Jacksonville to testify?
A. I do.
Q. Do you remember who you testified for, sir?
A. Well, I don’t testify for anybody, sir. I try to give the same testimony no matter who retains me, but it was Mr. Craig Dennis’s firm.
[This was the same defense lawyer in the courtroom in this case.]
Q. Yes, sir, and Mr. Dennis paid you, right?
A. Oh, sure. I charge for my time just like everybody else does.
Q. Yes, sir. Well, we’re going to talk a little bit more about your charges, sir. But that case over in Jacksonville — you told the jury the same thing. You get up at 4:00 a.m., you do the work on — at 4:00 a.m. and on the weekends. Do you recall that testimony?

MR. DENNIS: Objection, Your Honor. This is improper impeachment. If he has something that he wants to read he can ask him if it’s what he says, and we would just object to that.
THE COURT: Okay.
MR. FOX: I can do that, Judge.
THE COURT: Okay.
BY MR. FOX:
Q. We’ll come back to that in just a moment, Doctor. Doctor, see if you remember this question. I’m trying to find out — look for the specific part of what I’m trying to find here. Ah, yes.
MR. DENNIS: Also, please have a designation of what it is you’re reading from.
MR. FOX: Sure. Sure, sure. It’s the trial transcript. Mr. Dennis was a counsel in the case of Jackson versus Soud, page ten. You’re asked the question: How much of your time — obviously, you’re testifying and you’re being asked questions by Mr. Dennis here. How much of your time — obviously, you’re testifying here in this medical legal environment –how much of your time is devoted to doing this type of activity in your practice? And you say, your answer is: Well, Mr. Dennis, I’m a full-time doctor. I’m in private practice in Albuquerque. I primarily do consultations in infections in children. There are only two of us in the state of Mexico (sic), that’s — said the same thing here. There’s one doctor over at the university, and there’s me at the big Presbyterian hospital that I mentioned. And that’s all there is in the whole state, so we’re pretty busy, as you can imagine. This sort of
thing, the reviews of cases for attorneys, I do in my full time, if I can put it that way. So I have two kids, so I do it at four in the morning, I do it on weekends. And then, of course, for a trial I’m having to take time out from my practice to come here, obviously.
Do you recall that question?
MR. DENNIS: Objection, Your Honor. That’s exactly what he just said. Improper impeachment.
THE COURT: Okay. That’s consistent with what he said.
MR. FOX: Yes, sir. He said he didn’t recall it, which is why I was bringing it up.
THE COURT: It’s consistent.
[Here both the court and defense counsel have misconstrued the point of the impeachment. Impeachment with prior testimony isn’t limited to showing inconsistent testimony. Here, the cross-examiner’s point is that the testimony is too consistent, that is, the witness is following a script. But since the objection doesn’t go anywhere, there is no point arguing it.]
BY MR. FOX:
Q. And, in fact, Dr. Radetsky, that was not the first case in which you testified for Mr. Dennis’s firm or the George, Hartz, and Lundeen firm, is it?
A. I don’t really testify for anyone, but I have been retained by Mr. Dennis’s firm before. And I think really in the questioning that Ms. Santoro took me through, I think I already told the jury that I had been retained by her firm before.
Q. Yes, sir. What I was trying to get at was the magnitude. You didn’t tell us how many times you had been hired by Mr. Dennis’s firm or Ms. Santoro’s firm. That’s what I was trying to get at. And, in fact, sir, you’ve been hired, between those two law firms — not just her firm, probably 21, 22 times; is that fair?
A. I don’t think so, sir. But, again, since I don’t keep a running total of these things, I think that Mr. Dennis’s firm has consulted me a number of times and –
Q. How many?
A. Well, I’m thinking four, five times would be probably the number. It may be a little higher than that. With regards to Ms. Santoro’s firm, she’s never consulted me before, but I’ve reviewed cases for that firm certainly in the past.
Q. Do you remember who you testified for, sir?
A. Well, I don’t testify for anybody, sir. I try to give the same testimony no matter who retains me, but it was Mr. Craig Dennis’s firm.
Q. Yes, sir, and Mr. Dennis paid you, right?
A. Oh, sure. I charge for my time just like everybody else does.
Q. But, in any event, can we agree, Doctor, that in the 450 cases in which you’ve testified, either by deposition or at trial, that in 95 percent of the cases you’ve testified for the defendants and against the patient?
A. Well, again, sir, I don’t testify for or against anyone. I try to give exactly as accurate a testimony as I can no matter who may have retained me. I think that’s the job of an expert is to give accurate testimony. It is true that I would say 95 percent of the time, by the time it comes to a deposition or a trial, I’m brought there by a defense attorney, but my testimony is not for or against anyone.
Q. Yes, sir. You are brought there by and paid for by a defense lawyer to testify in a case against a baby or a baby’s parents. Isn’t that true, sir?
A. No. Mr. Fox, again, I’m not testifying for or against anyone. I think that that’s really a mischaracterization of what my job is. My job is to try give accurate and, I hope, scientifically based testimony to the jury for them to make the decision.
Q. Yes, sir. Well, how about you and I not quibble about words. In 95 percent of the cases you-are paid by the defense; can we agree to that?
A. Yes.
[ This was a good turnaround question to get the witness to agree with what the cross-examiner wanted here. It was obvious that the witness would not agree with the fact that he “testifies for” someone, so specifically pinning down who pays him was a good way to step around that dodge. And after the witness had repeated, too many times for his own credibility, that he doesn’t testify for or against anyone, this starkly highlighted the key point. The witness then finds a reason to reassert his objectivity. One could argue that the point had been made and the cross-examiner should have moved on, rather than hammer the point. But at some point here, the witness’s protestations of objectivity come to seem overly slick.]
Q. And in 95 percent of the cases you come in and you tell a jury that the defendant did nothing wrong or anything the defendant did didn’t cause an injury or death?
A. No, sir. That’s not what my job is. My job is, first of all, to answer the questions put to me, but secondly, to try to give the jury as accurate and honest testimony as I can based on the science that I know. So, again, you’re really mischaracterizing what I think the job of an expert witness — at least me as an expert witness actually is.

Q. Doctor, can we at least agree that in 95 percent of these cases in which a lawsuit is brought by a parent or by a child against a doctor or healthcare provider, your testimony is paid for by the defendant?
A. I think you asked me the question already, sir.
MR. DENNIS: Objection, Your Honor. It’s already been asked and answered. It’s
repetitious.
THE COURT: Well, just — I don’t know that he had a straight answer. Was it a yes or a no? Can you just answer the question, whether it’s accurate or not?
THE WITNESS: Yes, that’s true, sir.
[It doesn’t hurt when the judge steps in, which sometimes happens with overly slick witnesses.The questioning went on to highlight the corollary point – that a testimonial history of always being on one side meant that the witness was never on the other side – a point worth making to drive in the core point.]
Q. In fact, Doctor, in all the 25 years that you’ve been doing this, you’ve only come in and testified for a patient or a patient’s family how many times at trial?
A. Again, I don’t testify for or against. But out of the trial testimony that I’ve given, I have been brought there by a plaintiff’s attorney now I think four times.
Q. Four times in 25 years?
A. That’s correct.
[Considering the number of cases the witness has participated in, the stark number contrast works well here. Fox didn’t let the line of questioning go there, but had one more angle on it that ended with a bang. The witness fences with questions about his testimonial pattern by first denying any inconsistency in his prior answers to the questions, then claiming a lack of knowledge, then when the fact that he had at one time prepared a list (required in federal court) comes out, well, let’s see what happens. ]
Q. Doctor, would it be fair to say that with respect to the testimony you have given in the past in deposition that you have given wildly inconsistent testimony about the number of times that you’ve testified and who you’ve testified for and so forth? Can we at least agree to that?

A. I don’t believe that’s true, sir. I try to give an honest answer each time.

Q. Well, let’s — well, Doctor, in the year – let’s go back to the 19 — no, we won’t go back that far, let’s start in 1999. Eight years ago. In 1999, sir, every time you testified in court or by deposition, it was for a defendant, wasn’t it?

A. You know, sir, I don’t remember what my activity was eight years ago in medical legal cases. I’m just afraid I can’t answer your question.

Q. Well, that’s fair. I appreciate you telling me that. Do you recall your deposition being taken in the Palmer versus Keller case on April 27th, 2001, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Page 14. See if you remember being asked these questions and giving this answer. Line 16. In 1999, those 28 times you testified in medical malpractice cases, was every one of those testimonies for the defendant doctor or hospital? Answer, I believe so.

Q. Do you recall that question and that answer, sir?

A. I’m sorry, sir. You’re asking me about events that happened eight years ago, and I don’t recall questions and answers of a particular case.

Q. Do you recall, sir, that in the year 1998 every case you testified in was for a defendant, 100 percent of the cases?

A. Again, sir, I don’t have that information. I’m sorry.

Q. I appreciate you telling me. Same deposition, page 15, line four. Question: And in 1998 was 100 percent of your testimony for cases on behalf of the defendants? Answer, Yes.

Q. Do you recall that testimony, sir?
A. No, I don’t, sir. I presume you’re reading it accurately, but I don’t recall that. I’m sorry.

Q. Now, these days, Doctor, you’re giving – what would you say, 30, 40 depositions a year?

A. No, sir. I give between 20 and 30 depositions a year.

Q. Thirty would be a fair number, you think?

A. I said between 20 and 30.

Q. You know, in the first two months of this year alone you had given at least five or six depositions; would that be fair, sir?

A. It might be true, sir. I’m sorry. I just don’t keep a running total.

Q. What you did do at some point though, Doctor, was create a list of cases in which you testified. Do you recall doing that?

A. Yes. The last time, I believe, I did that in a federal court was a federal court up in Idaho, and they have a requirement that you put a list together, so I did it to the best of my ability.

Q. Yes, sir. And you created that list on your computer, didn’t you?

A. Yes, it was typed on the computer.

Q. And since that time you’ve been asked for that list by many, many lawyers, haven’t you, sir?

A. No, I haven’t been asked about that list by many lawyers, but I have been asked about it. In fact, I think I was asked about it in the deposition I gave in this case.

Q. Yes, sir, you were, because you reviewed the deposition you gave in this case, right?

A. Of course. I have it with me.

Q. And it turns out that with respect to that list — and you’ve been asked for it by lawyers other than just us, sir; isn’t that true?

A. No. I have been asked by lawyers — it’s not an uncommon question — whether I keep such a list, and I don’t. And they may ask if I’ve ever compiled such a list, and if they do I give them the answer.

Q. Doctor, were we the first lawyers to ask for that list?

A. You know, sir, I think I just answered your question. I have been asked by other attorneys, and I give them the answer to the questions that they ask me.

Q. So the answer would be yes, other lawyers have asked you for the list?

A. I think I have said that already.

Q. And what you’ve told those lawyers, sir, is that you can’t create a copy of a list. You haven’t kept a copy of it. Isn’t that correct?

A. What I told them is I don’t keep a copy of the list. And then if they ask me whether I’ve ever compiled such a copy, I give them the answer.

Q. Now, after you compiled the list, what did you do with it?

A. I sent it to the attorney who requested it of me.

Q. And you deleted it from your computer?

A. That’s correct, sir.

[This might have been a good opportunity to break the old rule against asking ‘why’ questions on cross. Is there any good answer to why a witness would delete a list of his testimonial work from his computer? It’s especially pertinent here, as the witness feigned lack of memory about his earlier accounts of his testimonial history. Variations of the ‘why’ question, each with their own lines of potential followup, depending on the answers, could have included:
• Is it something you want to run away from, your history of which cases you’ve testified in?
• Or, “if you were proud of your testimonial history, why wouldn’t you save it?”
• When you pressed the ‘delete’ button, were you thinking you would never need this document again? (If yes, he was retiring from the testifying game, and if no, other avenues of questions open.)
• Were you running out of room on your computer’s hard drive?
• Is there any chance you were trying to make it hard for adverse lawyers to find out the details of your testimonial history? ]
[The next topic that Fox turned to with this witness was his pay for the case. ]

Q. Now, Doctor Radetsky, how much are you being paid in this case? I know what your hourly rate is. I want to know how much — by the time you get back to New Mexico — what the total bill for the defendants is going to be for your work in this case?

A. Are you asking me what my bill will be for coming here to Tallahassee?

Q. No, sir. I’m sorry. I didn’t ask the question right. What I thought I asked — well, I’ll try to ask better — is what is your total bill going to be, what — for all of the work that you’ve done in this case?

A. I don’t know, sir. I don’t have that information.

Q. Well, I understand you may not know it to the nickel, but give our jury the best estimate as to what your charges are going to be.

A. You know, I just don’t know. I’ve sent in invoices in the past and been paid for them, but I don’t have that information with me today.

Q. Well, I understand that you don’t, you don’t have all the invoices. I’m just asking for an approximation. Give us your best approximation as to what your total charges are going to be.

A. I just don’t know, sir. You know, the case was first sent to me four years ago. So, I’m sorry, I just don’t have that information.

Q. So could it be 30, 40, $50,000?

A. I don’t have the information, sir.

Q. Could it be as high as 30 or $40,000?

A. Again, sir –

MR. DENNIS: Objection, Your Honor. The question has been asked and answered. Objection.

MR. FOX: I’m just asking for a range.

THE COURT: I understand, I understand. If you can answer it, answer it. If you can’t, then that’s the best you’re going to get and you need to move on.

MR. FOX: I think you’re right.

Q. Doctor, let me rephrase the question. Can you give our jury your best estimate – I’m not asking you to the penny, but say within $5,000, give the jury your best estimate as to what your total charges are going to be for your work in this case.

A. I’m sorry, I can’t, sir. The time and the work has been spread out over four years, and I just don’t know.

Q. Well, let’s move on.

BY MR. FOX:

Q. Let’s visit, if we could, a little bit about Levi Slayton. And I listened carefully to your testimony. And I wrote down some notes. And correct me if I’m wrong, but your testimony is based upon the assumption that Levi Slayton was not sick before the illness occurred, and the illness being the time that he stopped breathing; is that correct?

A. It’s based on the medical records, that the child did not have an illness prior to the time his heart stopped.

Q. That’s an assumption of yours in this case?

A. It’s not an assumption, sir. It’s based on the records as they actually exist.

Q. It’s based upon your belief that that represents the true state of facts; can we at least agree to that?

A. Well, I mean, that’s the — that’s the information that’s available. So based on the information that’s available, I interpret the information.

Q. In any event, your understanding is Levi had no illnesses prior to his instantaneous death, correct?

A. He was not a sick child prior to his heart stopping. He –

Q. Is that a yes?

A. I’m sorry, sir. The reason — words are so tricky. He had problems as a newborn. He was a little bit premature. He had some feeding problems. Evidently, he had a bout or two of irregular breathing, but he wasn’t a sick child prior to his heart stopping.

Q. As far as you know, he had no illnesses prior to the time he stopped breathing; is that fair or not?

A. It’s fair as I use the word illness, but he had newborn problems. Feeding problems, he had the jaundice problem, but those aren’t illnesses in the way that can explain why his heart stopped. That’s why I’m trying to answer it my own way, sir.

Q. Well, Doctor, using your definition of illness, can we at least agree that you believe that Levi had no illnesses until he stopped breathing?

A. As I understand that word, sir, that is correct.

[I count seven questions before the cross-examiner obtains a clean, simple answer to the question.]

Q. You’ve read the deposition of Julie Slayton?

A. Yes.

Q. You don’t question her truthfulness or her memory, do you?

A. I’m sure she testified based on her best memory of the time.

[The concession implicitly made here is that the mother’s testimony about her son’s symptoms in his last day of life was truthful, which contradicts the witness’s basic assertion that the child had a silent disease without any detectable signs.]

Q. Let me ask you this. You — you understood why we went out, or why we took your deposition that was taken in Albuquerque?

A. It was taken in Albuquerque.

[Here’s a rare example of a professional witness being asked a “why” question on cross, and the witness not taking up the offer to give an extensive answer. That was likely because the witness knew he was about to be impeached with his deposition, and the “why” question was intended to set up the importance of the deposition.]

Q. And from the 400 plus depositions you’ve given, you understand that the reason we do that is so we can find out what opinions you have and what thoughts you have and so we can prepare ourselves for a trial like this. You understand that’s the purpose of the deposition.

A. That was even said at the time of the deposition, sir.

Q. Yes. Because folks like us, we’re lawyers, we’re not doctors, so we want to try to be thorough and get out all your opinions at the time of the deposition. And you understand that’s the process?

A. It was told to me at the time.

Q. But you knew it long before that, didn’t you?

A. You know, sir, I’m there to answer the questions that are put to me and to answer them honestly. My understanding is that’s the purpose of the deposition is so the person who’s asking the questions can get those answers.

[This witness has a habit of gratuitously inserting into his answers that his job is to answer questions “honestly.” The cross-examiner can either let it go, as here, and save for closing argument a comment on the curiosity of a witness asserting his own honesty without being asked, or the lawyer could confront the witness along these lines:

Isn’t this now the third or fourth time you’ve told us today that your job is to answer questions honestly?
Doesn’t that go without saying, when you get on the witness stand and you’ve taken an oath?
When you told us these several times that your job was to answer questions honestly, were you worried that someone might think you were dishonest?
Here the lawyer probes the honesty issue a little differently, by bringing out the witness’s attendance at law school. He drops it after a couple of questions and returns to impeaching with the deposition. Here his approach is to ask the witness to contradict what he has just said, that the child had no illness before his lungs and heart stopped working, and to agree instead with the plaintiff’s contention that the baby had a lung infection for a day before his death. When the witness disagrees with the plaintiff’s contention, only then does he spring out the deposition transcript. ]
Q. Yes, sir. And you probably know that from law school, right? You went to law school, didn’t you?

A. Well, I went to one year of law school, many years ago, sir.

Q. And did you learn about depositions at law school?

A. No, I didn’t.

Q. In any event, Doctor, while you and I may disagree about some things about Levi Slayton, one of the things we can agree on is that, for at least a day or so leading up to the time that Levi Slayton stopped breathing, for at least a day or so, maybe more, Levi Slayton had pneumonia?

A. No.

Q. Do you have your deposition there, Doctor?

A. I do, sir.

Q. Page 60?

A. Six-oh?

Q. Six-oh, yes, sir.

A. All right.

Q. See if you remember this question being asked and you giving this answer. So now, if I understand correctly, Doctor, you don’t believe Levi had any illness up until the time that he stopped breathing?

Answer: In retrospect, he must have had the pneumonia for a day or so based on what I understand to be the histology of the lungs at the time of autopsy, but there were no clinical manifestations of it.

A. That’s correct, sir.

Q. Do you remember giving that answer to that question?

A. I do. I thought I gave exactly the same answer moments ago.

Q. No, sir, you didn’t. Now, if in fact, as you testified under oath, Levi had pneumonia at least a day or so before he stopped breathing, Levi would have had pneumonia at the
time that Dr. Penrod examined him. Is that true, sir?

A. No.

MR. FOX: Those are all the questions I have, Your Honor.

[The examination ends with the witness having contradicted himself: (1) No, the child had no illness before he stopped breathing; (2) Yes, the child had pneumonia for a day before he stopped breathing; (3) But no, the child didn’t have the pneumonia when the doctor examined him a day before he stopped breathing. While it’s usually better to bring out a multitude of contradictions when doing a contradiction cross-examination, it worked here to focus on a single subject because it was (a) central to the case, and (b) the witness had a three-way contradiction, and (c) all this followed a bias impeachment where the witness evaded giving a straight answer.]
Dr. Rosenberg, my name is Rick Friedman, and I represent Mr. Mead. Now, the fact that you’re a forensic psychiatrist means that you basically offer your services to lawyers and insurance companies, is that right?
A. Well, I’m not only a forensic psychiatrist. I have also — I am also a clinical psychiatrist. As a forensic psychiatrist, part of what I do is serve as an expert to attorneys or insurance companies. There are also other elements to what I do.
Q. All right, but essentially — and we’ll get into the facts and figures later — but the majority of your professional life is spent working for lawyers or insurance companies, is that fair to say?
A. Lawyers, insurance companies or administrative agencies, that would be fair to say.
Q. All right, and what that means is when you’re in a forensic context, you’re not treating anyone, is that right?
A. At the present time that would be true. There have been times where I worked in a prison treating people.
Q. But at this point in time your forensic work does not involve helping people to get better in any way?
A. That’s correct.
Q. All right, and it’s the forensic psychiatrist’s responsibility to highlight and emphasize facts favorable to the side that hired them and to de-emphasize or ignore facts that don’t help the side that hired them, is that fair to say?
A. No, I would say that’s a gross mischaracterization.
[The statement actually comes from a treatise which the witness had already cited to the court for a defense motion. The witness had written another unrelated chapter in the same book. One effective way to use treatises is to first put the statement forward that the attorney wants to use, elicit the witness’s comment, then reveal the source of the statement. That’s an especially good way to see if a witness will disagree with something the witness has written or is closely associated with, as this treatise is.]
Q. Isn’t that what most forensic psychiatrists believe?
A. Your assertion is what most of them believe?
Q. Yes, yes.
A. I wouldn’t say so, no.
Q. You filed an affidavit for the judge in this case, do you recall that, actually, a declaration?
A. Yes.
Q. All right, and a declaration is a statement under oath upon which a party offers and asks the Court to rely upon, is that right?
A. I’m not an attorney, but that sounds about right.
Q. Yes, and you’re very familiar with declarations and how the court systems work, aren’t you?
A. Yes.
Q. All right, and in your declaration you cited to Judge Mahan a book called Principles and Practices — Principles and Practice of Forensic Psychiatry, Second Edition, are you familiar with that book?
A. I’m familiar with the book. I don’t recall whether or not I had cited that in my declaration.
Q. If you’d turn to page five, lines seven and eight.
A. Okay.
Q. Did you cite that text to the judge?
A. (Reading.) Yes.
Q. And you cited it to the judge because you considered it a reliable resource regarding forensic psychiatry, is that right?
A. No, I cited it as a one reasonable basis for this particular assertion about malingering, not as a blanket reliable source in forensic psychiatry.
[Here the seasoned witness begins to fence with the lawyer over whether the text he has cited meets the magic-word criteria of “reliable authority” so the lawyer can quote from it to the witness.]

Q. Well, you wouldn’t be citing the Court to an unreliable source in forensic psychiatry, would you?
A. Well, certainly I didn’t pick out something that I thought was unreliable, but again the premise that I, therefore, accept the entire text or chapter as necessarily reliable or authoritative doesn’t follow in my mind.
[This is a common expert dodge for a treatise. The expert mixes two different concepts: the publication’s overall reliability and authoritativeness versus whether the witness agrees with the treatise’s entire contents. If agreement with a particular statement was the foundation requirement for using a treatise on cross, then no cross-examiner could ask a witness about any statement in a publication with which the witness disagreed. See Fed. R. Evid. 803(18), section (B), which requires that “the publication” not necessarily the statement inside the publication, be established as a reliable authority. See margin for the rule’s full text. ]
Q. So you’re kind of picking and choosing amongst the portions of the book that will support your case and the portions that don’t?
A. No, it’s that I’m not willing to fall into agreeing that everything in the chapter or the book that you could find is necessarily authoritative. I gave what is a scholarly and appropriate quote in support of my declaration.
Q. I wasn’t asking you to admit it was authoritative, but you thought the book was a reliable resource, didn’t you, that’s why you own it, that’s why you cited it to the judge?
A. I wrote one of the chapters on PTSD in the book, so I certainly think it’s a good book, but again I’m not willing to accept that the entire book or even the entire chapter is reliable. Things change over time, things — those are all summary chapters. Yeah, things change over time, evaluations are more sophisticated, so I don’t know how else to put it.
Q. All right. Well, let me ask you about a section in your book –
MR. FRIEDMAN: Your Honor, may I show this to the witness on the screen?
THE COURT: Yes, sir.
[The witness has come close to acknowledging the reliability of the treatise, but to make sure, the lawyer asks the judge for permission to display it.]
BY MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q. This is from page 11 in the book, Dr. Rosenberg, and it reads, both attorneys and forensic psychiatrists —
Q. Most attorneys and forensic psychiatrists consider it the responsibility of the forensic psychiatrist to put a spin on the data and highlight and emphasize facts favorable to their side and de-emphasize or even ignore data that are not. Do you agree with that statement?
A. No, I don’t. For attorneys, yes, not psychiatrists.
[Now the lawyer links the treatise to his theme, which he announces directly to the witness.]
Q. Well, that’s what you did in this case, isn’t it, Dr. Rosenberg, you highlighted the facts that support your malingering theory and deemphasized or ignored the facts that don’t support that theory?
A. Again I would grossly disagree with that. I wrote a thirty-plus page report and reviewed hundreds of pages of documents. I think I did a very reasonable and balanced evaluation.
[The witness has just established the criteria by which he should be judged: “very reasonable and balanced.”]
Q. Tell us the facts that appear in your report that support the theory that Mr. Mead is genuinely disabled.
[The question directly follows the witness’s declaration that he did a “very reasonable and balanced” job. The lawyer promptly challenges the witness to prove he’s balanced. The question as posed is narrower than first glance might indicate. The key words are “facts that appear in your report,” which of course Friedman has read closely.]
A. Well, there are his — I give a detailed account in my interview section as well in the review of records — his subjective claims that he’s disabled and the nature of his symptoms, et cetera. It would be tough for me to give a reason in the opinion section in support since the facts are so overwhelming that it’s a faked CFS claim.
Q. That’s it? Those are the only facts you came up with in your entire evaluation that support Mr. Mead’s claim of disability, is that right?
A. Well, in addition I’ve mentioned in my depositions, and I’d have to look and see if I mentioned it in my report as well, I phrased things that there are no significant findings in support of his CFS claim. You can always find in this amount of information some little suggestion, some slight oddity, in the neuropsychological testing, and again in all of his subjective claims, but there’s no significant information that would support a genuine claim.
Q. One of the things that forensic psychiatrists do is evaluate the credibility of sources, is that right, sources of information?
A. Well, of relevant sources of information, yes.
Q. All right, and you found Gena Mead to be a relative [relevant] source of information, is that right?
[This is the plaintiff’s ex-wife.]
A. Yes.
Q. So did you consider that her reports about Mr. Mead and his disabilities were credible?
[The cross-examiner confronts the witness with the expert’s credibility judgments.]
A. Well, I certainly always take that into account, and particularly since she would be entitled it’s my understanding to some of his money from a case like this, I’d certainly take into account what she says that she might intentionally distort some of it as well, but it certainly was of significance what she reported. In the same deposition that she reported the things that I’ve relied on and mentioned today, she also described in detail her own subjective statements in support of his CFS, so it certainly runs both ways.
Q. Well, is it a subjective statement if she reports what she observed from living with him for twenty-eight years? Is that — do you consider that subjective?
A. Yes, I would consider it subjective. First of all, it’s her personal interpretation colored by many factors, and it’s also the fact again that she also has her own personal secondary gain at stake in a case such as this.
Q. And both of those things are true of you, aren’t they, Doctor? What you’ve given us is your personal interpretation of the facts, just like Gena Mead did, and you yourself have an economic motive, don’t you?
[A “sauce for the goose, sauce for the gander” question intended to highlight the expert’s own financial bias.]
A. Well, again I would disagree strongly with both. I’ve tried to lay out painstakingly the scientific basis for the extraordinary number of reasons in support using what are generally accepted ways of making these analyses, and I get paid the same whatever the outcome, so I don’t have the same kind of financial stake.
Q. Aren’t you supposed to weigh the evidence in favor of your hypothesis as well as the evidence against your hypothesis?
A. Absolutely, you’re supposed to weigh the evidence.
[The expert agrees he is supposed to weigh both sides, and the cross-examiner immediately confronts his failure to weigh the other side here.]
Q. All right, and where on your report did you weigh the evidence of Gena Mead’s reports of Cliff Mead’s physical degeneration over a period of years?
A. Well, it would be tough because I didn’t review that material until after my reports were done, but in recently reading her deposition, I highlighted the facts that were relevant when I was talking about the reasons in support of malingering.
Q. But not the facts that would be relevant in support of the theory that Mr. Mead is disabled, is that right?
A. Not her subjective statements in support of that, that’s correct.
Q. What you’re doing is you’re picking and choosing from Ms. Mead’s deposition taking the portions that support your theory and ignoring or de-emphasizing the rest, isn’t that right?
A. Again I would disagree. I started out with a particular opinion that the evidence scientifically supports malingering. I was giving reasons to support that opinion, and as I’ve just mentioned, there certainly is plenty of subjective information from her describing his CFS symptoms.
Q. Did you just say that you started out with the opinion he was malingering, and then you were supplied with reasons to support it?
[The witness has just slipped up and made an apparent admission that he started with the opinion first, then fit the facts to it. This is a good instance of the payoff from listening closely to the witness’s responses and moving to immediately challenge them.]
A. I think that — I apologize if I didn’t state myself in what I said clearly.
Q. I’m sorry, is that what you psychiatrists call a Freudian slip?
A. I don’t know if that’s a joke or if you wanted me to give you an expert opinion, but in any case, if I could finish my answer what I was saying then when I started to testify today with regard to the opinions — the opinion of malingering and then the reasons in support of it from a scientific basis, I was laying them out, and I integrated my recent review of her deposition.
Q. Did I understand from your testimony that you wrote a chapter or article in a book called Comprehensive Textbook on Psychiatry, a chapter on ethics?
A. Yes.
Q. Would you show me where in the book that chapter is?
A. The one in that edition is written by Lipian and Mills (phonetic). I wrote it for the previous edition.
Q. Oh, so you don’t have a current edition of this book with your article in it?
A. That’s correct.
Q. You weren’t trying to mislead anybody by implying — well, you weren’t trying to mislead anybody by saying that you had a chapter on ethics in the Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, were you?
A. No, since I do have a chapter on ethics in the Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, and you have my curriculum vitae with the dates of my publications.
Q. So as I understand it, you spend one day a week with patients?
A. Yes, I see about thirty patients one day a week.
Q. How many minutes is that per patient?
A. It varies, usually an hour for an intake for a new patient, and then fifteen to thirty minutes for follow-up patients.
Q. Fifteen to thirty minutes times thirty patients, and what do you do for patients in fifteen to thirty minutes?
[Echoing the witness’s arithmetic often works. If any jurors do math in their heads, they will see that to see 30 patients in a single day would require no more than 15 minutes apiece for an ordinary 8-hour day.]
A. I conduct a psychiatric follow-up visit reviewing their current emotional complaints, signs, and symptoms of emotional problems, review their current physical complaints, their psychiatric and nonpsychiatric medications, if there’s any issue of substance use, try to provide a little bit of support as appropriate, and then it’s primarily geared to their — the medical evaluation and use of psychiatric medication.
Q. Out of these thirty patients you see a day, approximately how many are you prescribing medications for?
A. All of them.
Q. So basically they come in to you to get their medications, and you make sure it’s appropriate to keep giving them their medications, is that fair to say?
A. Well, I already described to you how I would characterize what I do for each of them, so I don’t know how to rephrase it for you.
Q. Ninety percent of your income comes from forensic work?
A. That’s correct.
Q. You’ve spoken to insurance company trade groups on occasion?
A. Once in Florida I spoke to a large — I don’t know what you’d call it — convention group.
Q. And in that talk you addressed the subject of objectifying subjective complaints?
A. I don’t recall, I may very well have.
Q. Do you recall testifying in a case called Abner versus Paul Revere Insurance Company?
A. Yes.
Q. Let me just show you page 93 from your deposition in that case. [Pause for sidebar conference.] All I wanted to ask, Doctor, is whether this refreshes your recollection about talking about teaching the insurance people about objectifying subjective complaints?
A. Yes.
Q. Now, as I understand it, you do — well, I should just ask you — I think you told us you’ve done thirty to thirty-five IME’s for Unum Provident?
A. For Unum Provident and subsidiaries, I would say that’s about right.
Q. All right, that includes Paul Revere, and Provident, and Unum?
A. Right, companies like that.
Q. All right, and when they hired — let’s make a distinction between cases in litigation and cases that are not in litigation. That thirty to thirty-five for Unum Provident related companies is for cases not in litigation, is that correct?
A. That’s correct.
Q. All right, and when they hire you to do these IME’s, you give them a reduced rate, don’t you?
A. No, I don’t give them a reduced rate, but I try to keep the evaluation to roughly $4,000.00 to $5,000.00 unless it’s an exceptional circumstance.
Q. In fact, didn’t you testify in the Abner trial that you put a cap on your evaluation charges to them which effectively gives them a reduced rate?
A. I don’t recall saying that it effectively gives them a reduced rate, but with insurance carriers, with these IME’s across the board as well as other types of evaluations that I do for the medical board, other agencies, I often will give them a cap even though I charge $300.00 an hour, my usual rate.
Q. I am going to show you page 14 of the transcript of the trial . I think it’s of your transcript in the trial. You were asked by Mr. Quigley (phonetic), I believe, well, you’ve got a reduced rate with the insurance companies for doing evaluations and writing reports, so even if you spend a lot of hours over that $4,000.00, you don’t charge them for that, right? And you answered, that’s correct. Does that sound about right?
A. Well, in the previous two lines it’s clear that I was saying that the way I look at it I charge $300.00 an hour, and I give them a cap. The second part of that question pertains not to a reduced rate, but the cap, and I agreed to that.
Q. How many of these evaluations do you do each month?
A. Well, I see — like I said, I see about thirty patients a week, I do about three or four evaluations for Unum Provident a year on average, I would say.
Q. I’m asking how many forensic evaluations do you do a month?
A. I would say three to four.
Q. Does three to eight sound a little more accurate?
A. No, at the present time I’d say it’s more like three to four. There’s certainly times it could go up to a range of eight.
Q. You’ve also been hired by Barger and Wolen which is Mr. McKennon and Mr. Hess’s firm on occasion, haven’t you?
A. Yes.
Q. Approximately how many times?
[Here is a narrow factual question, asked non-leadingly, which pays off for the cross-examiner because the witness gives a number trying to downplay his experience with the defense law firm.]
A. I would say roughly five times or so.
Q. Do you recall testifying in Abner that Barger and Wolen had hired you between five and ten times to work on Unum Provident cases?
A. I don’t recall it being that many. It’s certainly possible, but I would say it’s more in the range of five. It could be as high as ten.
Q. In fact, at page 16 Mr. Quigley asked you, is it true that there have been five cases that you’ve been asked to be an expert on in litigation for Paul Revere or Provident that you have been retained by the Barger and Wolen firm? And you answered, actually, I think in my deposition I had said over a period of years, it has been more like five to ten. Does that sound about right?
A. Again I would say from what I recall, it’s more like five but it might be five to ten. I’d be happy to look at anything that reviews that.
Q. And that’s just talking about the time Barger and Wolen hired you for Unum Provident cases, is that right?
A. Right, those are cases that I had previously evaluated for Unum Provident, and some of them are cases that are in litigation where I hadn’t seen the person before.
Q. And in those cases there’s no cap like there is in the prelitigation cases, correct?
A. That’s true.
Q. And you told us you’ve spent — or you’ve charged $20,000.00 in this case up until recently when you began to prepare for it again. Roughly how much time do you have in it since you completed your report?
A. Well, over the last few months it would be hard for me to say. I would say probably in the neighborhood of thirty hours maybe.
Q. At $300.00 an hour?
A. Yes.
Q. So another $9,000.00.
A. Yes, that would be a rough estimate.
Q. All right. Now, at the time you testified in Abner, in every case you could remember being hired by Barger and Wolen to defend Unum Provident, you had concluded that the plaintiff was a malingerer, is that right?
A. I don’t recall. I don’t consider myself hired to defend Unum Provident, but I was hired as a consultant on several cases for Unum Provident through Barger and Wolen. I don’t recall if I said that or not.
Q. By the way, these inconsistencies in your testimony today versus your testimony before, does that raise in your mind a credibility issue similar to what you’ve told us about Mr. Mead?
[Nice question! Of course the witness will say no, but the issue is raised for the jury.]
A. No, I wouldn’t say so.
Q. In each of the cases in which you were hired by Barger and Wolen, you disagreed with the treating doctors, isn’t that right?
A. I don’t recall if that’s the case or not.
Q. How many people have had their claims denied because of your reports or testimony?
A. Well, I don’t think anybody — first of all, I wouldn’t know what Unum Provident is doing after they get my report, but the determination of disability in my understanding has many parts to it according to their policy. My report is just one part of that.
Q. How many times have you given reports — well, let me ask it this way. Of the times you’ve expressed the opinion that in a forensic setting — you say you’ve done roughly a thousand?
A. I would say so.
[The cross-examiner now starts a line of questions about the expert’s “error rate.”]
Q. All right, let me start over. So out of the roughly a thousand times you’ve expressed an opinion in a forensic setting, how many times were you right and how many times were you wrong?
A. Well, I would say in the vast majority of cases in my opinion, and the way it was laid out in court if it got to court, it would be that my opinion seemed to stand the test of scrutiny. Many of the cases I’ve done never end up getting to the point of court, and so it would be hard to say if objectively somebody would say it’s correct or not. I don’t know how else to ascertain that.
Q. Well, let me ask a more pointed question. There is no way to quantify your error rate, is there?
[This question about an unknowable error rate for the expert only works as long as the cross-examiner’s side does not have a similarly credentialed expert subject to the same criticism.]
A. Well, I think based on the — when I do an examination in the type of methods that I’ve use today based on the available information, I don’t think that there is much of an error rate in terms of what the reasonable conclusions are from the information that I’ve reviewed. If there were additional information that contradicted my conclusions, then appropriately I should consider that information and consider revising my opinions, but given that my — the way I do things is I try to lay out the logical reasoning for my conclusions, and then present it to the jury or whoever the trier of fact is. I don’t think that has much of a significant error rate to it.
Q. Is there any way to tell scientifically?
A. Well, the best I can do is that the methods that I use are of the highest scientific level that I can for the kind of work that I do, and it’s based on adequate information to conduct my analysis, and that’s the best I can do.
Q. And the methods that you use are the methods of forensic psychiatry, is that right?
A. Well, I don’t know if we could say they’re the method of forensic psychiatry in general, but they are the most in my opinion appropriate in scientific methods for doing these kind of evaluations that you could find in forensic psychiatry.
[This line of questions might have benefited from more expansion aimed at showing that the work of forensic psychiatrists in assessing a patient’s alleged malingering is quite subjective and lacks standards that could then be used to measure an error rate. The cross-examiner now shifts to the related topic of biased sources of information, here, another expert whom the plaintiff alleges is notoriously biased in favor of the insurance industry.]
Q. Now, I think you told us earlier that the job of a forensic psychiatrist is to evaluate the credibility of information — not the only job but one of the jobs — is to evaluate the credibility of information sources?
A. Yes, of relevant information sources, I think that’s true.
Q. And one of the relevant information sources you’ve talked about today is Dr. Lees-Haley, is that correct?
A. Yes.
Q. And you’ve described him as a world authority?
A. Yes.
Q. Is it your view that Dr. Haley is an unbiased information source?
A. Well, with regard to the evaluations that I’ve seen just based on the work — I don’t know him personally — that’s my impression.
Q. If he were a biased information source, would that alter the way he influences your opinions?
A. If that were the case, it would alter them if it affected the evaluations of his that I’ve considered. For example, in this case if that’s some general issue, but it doesn’t affect his particular reports that I have to review, then it wouldn’t necessarily.
Q. Well, you’re dependent upon him, for example, let’s take this report, if he said Mr. Mead was fatigued, or Mr. Mead was energized, you have no way of knowing either way, right, in terms of what he observed in the session?
A. That’s correct.
Q. So, you’re dependent upon his credibility to the extent you’re relying upon his use of that information, is that fair to say?
A. Yes, that’s fair to say.
Q. All right. Now, were you given Dr. Lees-Haley’s deposition in this case?
A. No.
Q. And are you aware of Dr. Lees-Haley’s efforts to market himself to the insurance industry?
MR. HESS: Your Honor, may I just object? Dr. Lees-Haley was not deposed in this case. It was the concurrent case.
MR. FRIEDMAN: Oh, I’m sorry. That is correct.
BY MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q. Were you given his deposition in the Northwestern case?
A. No.
Q. Okay, and in that deposition , or we’ve got the report, he did one examination of Mr. Mead, is that correct?
A. That’s my understanding, yes.
Q. For this case and the Northwestern case, is that correct?
A. I don’t — I didn’t really recall one way or the other if his evaluation was also for the Northwestern case.
Q. All right, and if you were to become aware that Dr. Lees-Haley had addressed insurance agents and adjusters and told them not to bother calling — I’m sorry — not to call him until they’re ready to deny the claim, and basically told them he was on their side and was there to help them deny the claim, would that influence your view of his credibility?
A. Well, I think that certainly would be a significant thing to consider, but if it doesn’t affect the neuropsychological testing that he does in the report, then I wouldn’t let that affect my opinion in a particular case. If it was obvious that he either slanted the results of the testing, or slanted his opinions in some other way, then I would certainly consider that. But, you know, the testing is kind of like mathematics, there is a correct way to do it, and a correct statistical way to interpret it. As long as that’s done appropriately and someone with his expertise, I would still accept that work unless there was evidence of distortion.
Q. All right. We’ll get to evidence of distortion later. For now, have you ever met Dr. Lees-Haley?
A. No.
MR. FRIEDMAN: What I’d like to do — Your Honor, I’ve marked — I guess I should ask the clerk, what’s the next exhibit in line?
THE CLERK: 219.
MR. FRIEDMAN: Your Honor, Exhibit 219 is a divisional claim superintendent’s conference at State Farm corporate headquarters, Bloomington, Illinois. What I have is a transcript as well as a tape of Dr. Lees-Haley addressing the claims superintendents, and what I’d like to do is play a portion of that tape for Dr. Rosenberg and ask him if that influences his views of Dr. Haley and the conclusions that he came to.
[Sidebar omitted. The impeachment of the other defense expert becomes relevant to this expert because the cross-examiner set up the foundation that this expert had relied on a report by the other expert.]
(Videotape played.)
BY MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q. Is it the proper role of a medical person or a scientist to become an advocate in order to help insurance companies deny claims?
A. Well, I have a different interpretation of Dr. Lees-Haley’s tape, but certainly to make it your role to help insurance companies deny claims across the board would be inappropriate. To be a consultant to an insurance company, while I’ve never done that, I don’t think that, per se, would be considered inappropriate.
Q. Are you aware that Dr. Lees-Haley was a contributing editor to Claims Magazine for a number of years?
A. I didn’t even know there was something called Claims Magazine. So, no, I wasn’t aware of that.
Q. What percentage of the time is Dr. Haley — or Lees-Haley retained by insurance companies or the defense?
A. I have no idea.
Q. I am going to hand you the deposition of Dr. Haley. Page 42, line 16, do you see where Dr. Lees-Haley is testifying that for the last several years between ninety-five and ninety-nine percent of the cases for which he’s been retained as a forensic expert has been for defense cases?
A. Yes.
Q. Does that suggest to you any kind of bias?
A. It certainly suggests a concern for a potential bias. Again you’d have to look at not just what percentage he’s retained on, but then what he does with those cases. Is he willing to, you know, appropriately and fairly evaluate those cases? If not, then it certainly is a considerable concern, but again it’s also a separate issue if in this case he did his work appropriately or not or somehow distorted it.
Q. Distorting facts would be highly inappropriate for a forensic expert, wouldn’t it?
A. If it was done intentionally, it certainly would.
Q. All right, and just if you’d take a look at page 47, do you see that Mr. Lees — Dr. Lees-Haley’s work basically over ninety-five percent of his income comes from forensic work?
A. Yes, I see that.
Q. And on page 39 that he co-edited a handbook on psychological claims for insurance companies?
A. Yes.
Q. Coauthored another book that a surveillance expert markets to insurance companies? Page 40.
A. Yes.
Q. Does any of that suggest any issues with regard to Dr. Haley’s credibility or lack of bias?
A. Again I would say it does raise a significant concern, and it’s an appropriate thing to be concerned about, but he has tremendous qualifications on what he does, and you still have to look at with this particular evaluation is it expertly and properly done or not.
[The expert has handled this exchange pretty well, sounding reasonably open to the possibility of the other expert being biased. The cross-examiner proceeds to ask a “polarizing” question. Since the witness has already accused the plaintiff of faking his chronic fatigue syndrome, the expert does not flinch from the characterization.]
Q. Now, when you write a report calling somebody a malingerer, basically you’re calling them a liar and a fraud, is that right?
A. With regard to their claim of a psychiatric injury or disability, that’s correct.
Q. And so before you do something like that, you want to be really sure you’ve got it right, isn’t that correct?
A. Yes, I can never be one hundred percent sure, but I want to be, you know, as sure as I possibly can within reason that that’s correct.
Q. You know that if you — well, it would be a horrible thing, wouldn’t it, if you accused somebody of being a liar and a fraud and they lost their disability benefits and you were wrong?
A. Yes, that is certainly something I would feel bad about.
Q. And you want to make sure you look at all of the available evidence before you form an opinion like that, don’t you?
A. Not necessarily all of the available information, I want to look at all the pertinent information, all of the information that’s reasonably available and decide if I have sufficient information to form my opinions. It’s not realistic that I need to see all of the possible information, but I have to understand what is sufficient information to form my opinions.
Q. Well, how do you decide what’s sufficient?
A. Well, again it’s based on I lay out in a logical fashion what the reasons are that support my opinion and see if they are sufficient to warrant an opinion, for example, of malingering, and if there’s other information that comes to light to the contrary, I’m always happy to reconsider those opinions.
Q. You wouldn’t base an opinion of malingering on speculation, would you?
A. No.
Q. And if you discovered that there was important evidence, you had not been given, you wouldn’t be reluctant to change your mind, would you?
A. Well, if that important information was significant in changing my impression of the case, then I certainly would change my opinions. It needs to be relevant and significant first, but then I certainly would.
Q. Do you think it’s relevant and significant that Gena Mead thinks and observed Cliff Mead’s health deteriorating over a period of years, is that significant in your mind?
A. Well, as I mentioned earlier, that is certainly potentially significant, but the two problems are, one, you weigh it against all the other information we’ve discussed, which is overwhelming. And, secondly, that she has the same vested interest as Mr. Mead in getting money from a successful suit in this case.
Q. So you rely upon some of the things she says but not others, is that right?
A. Well, again I take these things into consideration and I weigh them, but her report that Mr. Mead was having an affair and was, you know, active with this other woman when he’s supposed to be worn out and unable to move, you know, I consider that as potentially relevant to my opinions. Again if there is something contrary that shows she was lying about that, I would be happy to consider that.
Q. Is there something that shows she’s lying when she describes his deterioration over a period of years?
A. There is important information that suggests that she’s potentially distorting that information for financial gain with Mr. Mead because obviously even if they’re divorced, she’s financially interested.
Q. All right, and that financial interest — well, let me ask you this, how did you weigh in the fact that Mr. Mead and Gena Mead had a divorce case going at the time she testified about the affair?
A. Well, again it’s a matter of — well, I’m not sure how to put it — it’s a matter of, you know, if you have a wife, or ex-wife, who is bringing up information that she’s finding out about him having an affair with somebody else, there are other sources of information as well, including, from what I understand from the testimony in this case, that supports that Mr. Mead was having an affair behind her back that that information is supported. If you look, for example, at some of the letters that were written to try to refute the neuropsychological evaluations, the former Mrs. Mead participates in that process of trying to refute some of the expert’s work without having the expertise to do so, and then there’s also a letter that apparently says it’s from Gena Mead that was actually written by Mr. Mead. There’s again a lot of tainted information related to Mrs. Mead trying to assist Mr. Mead with the case, but the information regarding his infidelity seems to be a reasonable thing to consider.
Q. So is Gena Mead lying when she tells us about what she observed with regard to Cliff Mead’s health over the years?
[This is an important question. The expert who accuses the plaintiff of being a fraud necessarily must view the plaintiff’s long-time wife as either a fraud herself or as badly duped by her former husband.]
A. She may or may not be, or maybe to some degree, but it’s sufficiently suspicious that it needs to be taken skeptically.
Q. All right, so you’re basically saying, yes, you believe that information is not worth weighing in the balance as you decide — as you try to decide whether Mr. Mead’s telling the truth or not.
A. Well, actually I weighed it in the way I just described to you.
Q. You weighed it and then threw it out?
A. Well, as I was saying I weigh it just as I weighed Mr. Mead’s subjective complaints over time. All of these things are weighed, but the information is still overwhelming for a faked a claim for CFS.
Q. Who else can you tell us is lying, Dr. Rosenberg?
[Another polarizing question that seeks to clarify the exact numbers of witnesses whom the expert accuses of giving false observations.]
A. Besides Mr. Mead?
Q. And Mrs. Mead, Gena Mead, who else?
[The expert now tries to back away from accusing the former wife of lying. The point of the question is to force clarity and not let the expert get away with an ambiguous “skepticism” about the ex-wife.]
A. Well, again I have to take exception to that because I think it’s a misstatement of my testimony. I didn’t say she was lying. I said there is sufficient evidence that you need to be very skeptical about her information and her vested financial interests in the outcome.
Q. You don’t believe her, do you?
A. It’s not that I don’t believe her, it’s that I’m sufficiently skeptical of it that I have to weigh that and all the other information that I considered because there’s other evidence of, first, her financial interest and, second, her assisting Mr. Mead in the past with trying to twist the outcome.
Q. A good lawyer or forensic psychiatrist could come up with reasons to disbelieve just about anyone, couldn’t they?
A. Well, I’m sure a good lawyer could do that. I would hope a forensic psychiatric who is competent and ethical wouldn’t do that without adequate basis.
Q. What reasons are there to disbelieve Mr. Mead’s partners when they testify?
A. Well, again in Mrs. Mead’s case, the former Mrs. Mead, there is her financial interest in the outcome of this case while at the same time it’s my impression that she did discuss the issues of the infidelity. In the case of the current Mrs. Mead, I don’t know if he she goes by that last name —
Q. I think you misunderstood my question. I’m talking about his business partners, what reasons are there to be skeptical of their testimony? This is an easy one.
A. Well, you know, certainly if they end up — any time people in business together end up having a falling out or disagreement, you always have to consider whether there is some difference of opinion of what really happened or somebody potentially altering the facts of what really happened. I hope I got it right.
Q. This skepticism you’re describing, did you feel skeptical about what the partners were saying?
A. Every item of information that I review, I always treat initially with skepticism.
Q. Were you aware that the partners and Mr. Mead had a lawsuit against each other?
A. Yes.
Q. That would be a reason to be skeptical, wouldn’t it?
A. That certainly would be an additional reason to be skeptical, but I always treat things skeptically in these cases.
Q. Dr. Rosenberg, I want to make sure that my notes are correct. Did you testify that one of the more significant pieces of evidence was how Mr. Mead had rated his levels of distress with Dr. Lees-Haley?
A. I don’t think if I said it was one of the more significant pieces of information with regard to his CFS claim, but it was certainly significant and seemed to also go to how goal driven Mr. Mead is to support his CFS claim that he would put that ahead of these other tragedies in his life.
Q. So the fact that he put CFS as a more severe distress than, say, the death of his son, to you means he’s malingering and trying to push his CFS claim inappropriately?
A. No, I don’t think that would be a reasonable characterization.
Q. What would be a reasonable characterization?
A. That while certainly you couldn’t make any conclusion that he was malingering based on something like that, when you take all the information together it is one additional item to consider with regard to his credibility in light of the other sources of information we’ve discussed that he is pushing his CFS claim so hard that he would elevate it unreasonably or inappropriately above these other things that have gone on in his life, and again it is something that is characteristically seen in individuals who malinger where they over advocate for themselves or over push their particular problems as the only thing going on in their lives.
[The cross-examiner has now committed the witness to saying that the plaintiff had elevated the significance of his chronic fatigue beyond other tragedies in his life. He now shows the witness the contradiction.]
Q. Didn’t Mr. Mead say to Dr. Lees-Haley that the most emotionally distressing experience of his entire life was the death of his son in 1996?
A. Well, I don’t recall specifically if he said that. If he did, I would wonder if that was with regard to his emotional reaction around the time of his son’s death, and that this was pertaining to his current emotional distress.
Q. Do you have a copy of Dr. Lees-Haley’s report with you?
A. Yes.
Q. Would you turn to page 5, please. Do you have it on your computer?
A. Yes. (Reading.)
Q. What Mr. Mead told Dr. Lees-Haley was that the most emotionally distressing experience of his entire life was the death of his son in 1996, wasn’t it?
A. Yes, that’s correct.
Q. He said the second most emotionally distressing experience was the death of his mother in December of 2000 from breast cancer, and the death of his younger brother by heart attack in March of 2001, isn’t that right?
A. Yes.
Q. You weren’t trying to leave the jury with the impression that Mr. Mead had said that having CFS was more emotionally distressing than the death of people in his family, were you, Dr. Rosenberg?
A. Well, actually with all due respect it’s my impression that you’re the one who is attempting to mischaracterize it because you left out the second paragraph which is what you described was his initial emotional reactions. The second paragraph which you deleted or didn’t mention was Dr. Lees-Haley’s interview of his level of emotional distress in the last twelve months. So with all due respect, I think you’re the one who has misled the jury.
Q. All right, and what he was asked about was several dozen psychosocial stressors and asked to talk about them with regard to the past twelve months, is that right?
A. Well, they then zero in on exactly the same ones that you just talked about. That’s correct that that’s the initial sentence of the paragraph.
Q. And at this point it’s what? Five years after his son has died?
A. That’s correct.
Q. It’s kind of hard to see here, Dr. Rosenberg, but can you tell us what the trails making Test is?
A. Trails — there are trails A and B. These are time tests in trails A where you’re connecting the numbers together in order like you were counting. In trails B there is an alternate pattern, a distraction pattern, that you have to avoid in connecting them together. So trails A is a simple test of attention. Trails B is a test not only of attention but of mental flexibility and sustained attention.
Q. And basically the trails making test, test A tests visual scanning and attention, is that right, visual scanning and attention?
A. I’m sorry? Can you repeat that?
Q. Yes. What the trails making A is concerned with is visual scanning and attention, is that correct?
A. Yes, that would be correct.
Q. All right, and on this test administered by Dr. Lees-Haley, Mr. Mead did worse than 99 percent of the population, is that right?
A. Excuse me one second. (Reading.) Yes, that’s correct.
Q. Am I pronouncing it right, Stroup (phonetic) Color Word Test, is that the way to pronounce it?
A. Yes.
Q. All right, that deals with problems with attention and how vulnerable someone is to distraction, is that right?
A. Right, so it pertains to not just attention but likewise sustained attention and frontal lobe tasks.
Q. And there again he does worse than ninety-nine percent of the population?
A. Yes, that’s correct.
Q. And on the second Stroup test, the interference test, that also tests how distractible he is?
A. Right, that’s more a frontal lobe measure.
Q. And on this frontal lobe measure, again he does worse than ninety-nine percent of the population?
A. Yes, that’s correct.
Q. And according to Dr. Lees-Haley, the scores indicate that Mr. Mead’s overall ability to pay attention and concentrate is seemingly quite variable, is that right? I know there’s more to it, but that’s the first sentence, is that right?
A. Yes, I agree with you that’s the first sentence.
Q. All right, and that’s actually consistent with what Mr. Mead had been reporting to his doctors for years, isn’t it, that sometimes he was able to concentrate and other times he had real troubles?
A. No, actually I would say that that really isn’t consistent at all for a couple of reasons. First, this actually — the trails is actually additional evidence of faked cognitive impairment because Mr. Mead did poorly on trails A, which is very simple, and did much better on trails B. There are several explanations for that, but one is that you’d have to be concerned about his level of intentional effort and also performing in the one percentile in trails A, simple attention. And the one percentile in these Stroup tests suggests somebody who is so impaired that it really doesn’t fit Mr. Mead’s day-to-day function, and again you wonder about his actual level of motivation, and also variability in test performance from one test to another in the same period of time is a very different thing than Mr. Mead’s description of variability in how well he was able to pay attention, function, let’s say, from one day to another.
[The witness has perhaps made the cross-examiner wish he hadn’t raised the topic of the “trails” tests, since he has a persuasive reason for why he sees the variable performance of the plaintiff as evidence of intentionally poor performance, and the cross-examiner has no good rejoinder to the point. But rather than wilt in the face of this strong blowback, the cross-examiner calmly moves to another area.]
Q. What’s your understanding as to the exercise — you’ve read his deposition, what exercise does Mr. Mead do at present or at the time of his deposition?
A. Well, in my interview with him, he said he did, you know, up to an hour of exercise a day, I believe walking and some light weights a few times a week. I apologize I don’t recall specifically what he said in his deposition, but it’s my understanding other information has come out that he doesn’t actually exercise beyond going shopping at the mall.
Q. Well, hasn’t he testified that he also uses light weights occasionally and does stretching exercises as well?
A. I apologize, he may very well have. I was speaking more of the cardio exercise in terms of recent testimony, but I apologize. That might be the case as well.
Q. All right, and what’s your understanding of what his doctors have recommended to him?
A. Well, which doctors are we discussing?
Q. Well, right, let me just ask some leading questions to move us through this. You understand that Dr. Cheney was not only diagnosing Mr. Mead but also treating him, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And you’ve had Dr. Cheney’s deposition, haven’t you?
A. Yes.
Q. And do you agree that Dr. Cheney testified that he put Mr. Mead on an exercise regime that involved mild weight lifting, stretching, isometrics?
A. I apologize. I don’t recall one way or the other.
Q. Let me hand you page 491.
A. Thank you. (Reading.)
Q. That’s what Dr. Cheney said for him to do, isn’t it?
A. If this is Dr. Cheney’s deposition, then, yes, it does say that on page 491.
Q. So Mr. Mead is doing exactly what Dr. Cheney told him to do, isn’t he?
THE WITNESS: Well, according to this it tells you what Dr. Cheney recommended. It doesn’t tell you what doctor — what Mr. Mead actually did.
BY MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q. But you’ve told us what your understanding is of what he’s doing, weight lifting, the stretching, so on, and that’s exactly what’s on the deposition, isn’t it?
A. Well, you told me that the recent testimony is that he was weight lifting and stretching. I don’t have that information one way or the other, but the key thing is the cardio exercise, and it’s my understanding that the recent testimony was that he wasn’t doing that beyond going to the mall or the market.
Q. And what Dr. Cheney said is that they, meaning chronic fatigue syndrome patients, should play to their strength which is anaerobic — is their anaerobic system so mild weight lifting, stretching, isometrics, is generally well tolerated as they give ten seconds — excuse me, sixty seconds between reps. So he’s recommending anaerobic exercise of the sort we just described, isn’t that right?
A. With the understanding that Dr. Cheney’s treatment regimen in general is not considered — evaluation or treatment — are not considered scientifically valid. That certainly looks like what he says in his deposition.
Q. So we know that one basis for your opinion that Mr. Mead is not following the directions of his doctors isn’t true, do you agree with that?
A. No, I wouldn’t agree with that.
Q. I didn’t think so. Would you agree that Mr. Mead had a good work ethic in college?
A. I have no idea what his work ethic was. I’m certainly impressed that he went to Stanford and got a MBA, but I don’t know enough about his work ethic in college.
Q. Wouldn’t that be something worth knowing if you are going to evaluate whether he’s malingering or not?
A. Well, not necessarily. I do recall one quote from Dr. Etcoff that in college he was interested in something like girls, cars, and passing. So I guess I do have that information, but his work ethic in college isn’t necessarily required given the other information about malingering.
Q. All right. Well, I guess what I’m asking you is — well, why don’t I just ask it this way. When did the malingering start?
[Another polarizing tactic seeks to pin down the witness on details that the witness would rather leave vague, such as when the malingering began.]
A. Well, it would be I think difficult for me to pinpoint, but as we discussed earlier, there is significant information that in the ’94, ’95 time period after Mr. Mead was pushed out of VCP as of June 30th of ’94, that he got the idea to switch from a claim for depression to chronic fatigue syndrome, and that he had to then try to get rid of information from Dr. Frohwirth, for example, that he already had prior problems with fatigue. So I think we could say that at least around then it had already come to mind, it might have been before that.
Q. And what is his motive for malingering?
A. Well, I think there are several easily understandable motives I mentioned earlier. One is, although it’s my impression that he’s very well off financially, there’s certainly the additional financial benefits. There’s not having to worry about working again. His job was very stressful with long hours. There is having the additional free time to spend with his new wife and in personal pursuits. You know, there are several reasons, and also for someone like Mr. Mead, while I admit that this is more speculative, you know, he’s somebody who has always been a winner and a competitor, and I can understand him once he decides he’s going to win this claim, that he’s going to see it through to the end, no matter how absurd it might become.
Q. So he’s a winner and a competitor in 1989, would you agree?
A. Well, I would say that in general is true for him. I assume it is for 1989.
Q. 1990?
A. It would be the same answer.
Q. When did he decide to be a health ridden malingerer as opposed to a winner?
A. Well, as I mentioned, although it might very well have been earlier, ’94, ’95, there is considerable evidence that that’s when he decided to switch over and try the fake CFS claim, but even at that point he’s still a competitor and trying to be a winner. He wants to win the game of successfully faking a CFS claim.
Q. So when he’s talking to his doctors and reporting symptoms in 1990, ‘ 91, ’92, is he malingering?
A. Well, I think we have to look at what doctors — for example, Dr. Anderson, his general physician, who saw him those years, said there is absolutely no evidence or complaint whatsoever of CFS.
Q. All right. I’m just asking you, when he went to his doctors, and he said, I have these symptoms, was he malingering?
A. Well, I apologize, we’d have to look at what symptoms, what doctor, what time period for me to answer that.
Q. Well, you’ve done that, haven’t you, you’ve looked at all of those medical records?
A. I have looked at all those medical records that I’ve discussed. But I apologize, to answer your question, I would need the parameters I just mentioned.
Q. Well, for example, when he goes to Dr. Epstein in ’92 and ’93, and he says he’s feeling depressed and fatigued, is he making that up? Is he lying?
[Further questions seek to clarify exactly what the witness is testifying about the plaintiff’s alleged malingering and, as part of that, lying to his own doctors.]
A. Well, I think the overwhelming evidence is that he probably is because again we have the — for example, the depositions of his partners that there is no evidence whatsoever of those problems, including they would travel with him across time zones, they were working with him intensely, no evidence of excessive fatigue, no evidence of depression. And as I mentioned earlier, in the 1995 letter Dr. Epstein said that the fatigue didn’t even start until ’94 as opposed to all of these other claims that started in ’91 when he was supposed to have known Mr. Mead so well.
Q. What’s his easily understood motive in 1992 for going into Dr. Epstein and talking of depression and fatigue, what’s his easily understood motive?
A. Well, I think there’s at least a couple potentially. One is it’s my understanding that by that point —
Q. Just to be clear, are you speculating about motives at this time, or do you have a scientific basis for telling us what his motive is in 1992?
THE WITNESS: The reasonable from a scientific standpoint, a reasonable estimate would be that around that time, given Mr. Mead’s history, it would be by ’92. The most likely reason would be he’d already been told by his partners he was going to be pushed out of VCP and not included in VCP Three, and so he’s now having to look for what he’s going to do for money, career, et cetera. So the timing is actually very eloquent, and also his job it stressful, long hours, there’s some evidence hours that he had an earlier affair around that time. He might also be wanting to spend more time with that person. There are certainly several possibilities that are reasonable to consider.
Q. Let’s go back then to ’91 before his partners ever say a word to him about any kind of trouble, and you’re aware that his partners told him they wanted him to leave in August of ’96 — or I’m sorry, August of — I better look that up — the middle of ’92, is that right?
A. Well, it’s my understanding that it was roughly in the middle of ’92, although that doesn’t mean that there weren’t earlier discussions about how his companies were failing and perhaps about the fact that he was withholding information from them, that was just when it reached its flash point.
Q. And, in fact, Mr. Kitchen testified, didn’t he, that the first time they raised concerns with Mr. Mead about his performance was late 1991 or early ’92, correct?
A. That certainly sounds about right, so that does include some of ’91.
Q. Late ’91?
A. Yes, that still is part of ’91, but, yes, late.
Q. So why is he going to doctors starting in late ’90 all the way through ’91 complaining of fatigue, congestion, pain in the muscles, why is he doing all of that in ’90 and ’91?
[Asking a “why” question on cross can be an effective way to confront the witness with contradictions. The witness dodges the question.]
A. Well, to properly answer that I would need to know what doctors’ records we’re talking about.
Q. All right. Well, let me ask the question this way then because we don’t have much time as you know. What is the easily understood motive that Mr. Mead would have for lying to his doctors in 1990 and 1991?
A. Well, with the caveat that again without looking at the records I can’t — I’m not accepting your premise as necessarily true that there is evidence that he did in the way you’re characterizing in ’91. It’s my understanding that, for example, the companies that he was responsible for were already failing by then. There is also his — apparently there is an affair around ’91. He also again had a very stressful job with long hours. There are still reasonably understandable incentives, although again I don’t necessarily accept that the circumstances were as you say in ’90 and ’91.
Q. All right. Well, you read Mr. Kitchen’s deposition, didn’t you?
A. Yes.
Q. And you would accept his description of the timing of when they told Mr. Mead certain things, wouldn’t you?
A. Yes.
Q. You talked about the stressors that he had, which stressors did he have in ’91? We talked about the death of his son, the death of his mother, none of those stressors existed in ’91, did they?
A. None of those, no.
Q. All right, and so you’re back to the business stressors, is that right?
A. Well, as I mentioned, he identified his work as extremely stressful, long hours, he’d often be — you know, he would sleep a few hours during the week and have to make up for it on the weekends, that it was very hard, high pressure work, and again also it’s my understanding that there was potentially an extramarital affair around ’91. So that also could have led to desiring a life-style change.
Q. And he’d always had high pressure stressful jobs, hadn’t he?
A. Well, I would need to know more about his other jobs. I mean, for example, being a CEO of this Miller Pasta, or some of the other things he did, they’re certainly very impressive jobs. I don’t know if those necessarily are as stressful as having to fly around the country trying to help these fledgling companies make good on the millions that were invested, and again there is also the issue potentially by ’90, certainly by ’91, that the companies were failing even if his partners hadn’t found out about it.
Q. In your malingering analysis, you have to evaluate what somebody has to gain by their behavior against what they have to lose, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. All right, and what he had to gain, if I understand what you’re telling us, is the money from the policy approximately — the two policies, Northwestern and Paul Revere — of about $180,000.00 a year, is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. And lots of free time, is that right?
A. Well, those are two of the things I mentioned, there were others as well.
Q. What else did he have to gain?
A. Well, reduced stress, not having to worry about launching another career after getting pushed out of VCP. I think those would be the primary ones.
Q. You said he wanted to pursue nonwork interests, what were those?
A. Well, one of them would be a girlfriend, another would be his things that he liked to do with his free time, for example, cultural activities potentially.
Q. What did he lose when he stopped working?
A. Well, it depends how you look at it. He was pushed out of VCP, so it’s not like he just voluntarily stopped working, but then he gained not having to try to start all over again with his own venture capital company or another business, but, you know, if you think about the kind of things that he potentially lost, it would be the prestige of a job like that. It would be, although it’s a gamble and a lot of work, potentially doing very well with it, although perhaps not. The excitement and satisfaction of the type of work he likes to do as a businessman being successful. Those are all possibilities.
Q. Yeah, he lost his career, correct?
A. Yes, that’s true.
Q. What was his earning capacity in that career, do you know?
A. I believe he earned about $600,000.00 a year plus he had a financial interest in at least some of those companies.
Q. How much — let’s talk first about how hard would it have been for him to get another job in the corporate world?
A. I think it would be extremely easy for Mr. Mead.
Q. And how much would that job that it would be easy for him to get pay?
A. Well, that’s not really my expertise, but I’m sure he would be able to get a very good corporate job, you know, certainly paying somewhere in at least a couple hundred thousand dollars, I would imagine.
Q. Maybe even more?
A. That’s why I said at least, it could be a lot more.
Q. All right. Now, by losing his job, he also lost his house, is that right?
A. I don’t recall him losing his house because of —
Q. I don’t mean losing as in foreclosed on, but he couldn’t support a $2.5 million house on $180,000.00 a year, could he?
A. Well, again I think we would need more information because my impression is that he has tremendous financial resources, and he also has testified that he has a significant income from stock investments.
Q. And you don’t know the particulars of that, do you?
A. No.
Q. You didn’t ask about the particulars of that, did you?
A. No.
Q. But if you’re doing this evaluation of gain versus loss, that’s an important thing to know, isn’t it?
A. Well, it could potentially be useful, but again while there are always additional things that could be picked out and focused on, there was more than sufficient information, overwhelming information, of the type I’ve already discussed.
[The answer shows the witness’s reluctance to make a gracious concession. Instead he reverts to his theme.]
Q. Gena Mead testified that as a result of their reduction in income, they lost their house, their children were taken out of private schools, they lost their ski house, he lost his business friends and associates, and he lost his social standing, do you have any reason to disagree with any of that?
A. Well, I think that would require further analysis because it turned out that he had, at least at some point, he had a girlfriend and had separate bank accounts and lots of finances related to her that he apparently was hiding from his wife, so I think that requires more information to really analyze.
Q. You don’t have that information, do you?
A. Beyond what I’ve described, no, I don’t.
Q. All right. Mr. Cummings and Mr. Kitchen each testified that Mr. Mead tried hard to stay in the partnership to keep his job, is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. Is that what malingerers do, they try hard to keep their job?
A. Well, given that I — despite the discussion we’re having, I haven’t actually testified that he was malingering as far back as ’93 or earlier. I would agree that that’s not generally what malingerers do, but if the malingerer or the person has an extremely stressful job with long hours, if the person’s companies are failing that he’s responsible for, the person looks like he’s going to be pushed out, that things are heading in a disastrous direction, there’s more to it than just him losing his job.
Q. So the malingering began after he was pushed out of his job, is that what you are telling us?
A. Well, I think it’s hard to pinpoint really when it began beyond what I’ve testified that clearly that period ’94, ’95, the evidence is quite strong that he decided to switch to a CFS claim and that there was clearly a malingering claim by then.
Q. One of the reasons supporting your position is that his partners saw no evidence of sickness or illness, is that correct?
A. Yes.
[The cross-examiner now asks the witness a series of facts from the depositions of the plaintiff’s business partners, all of which the witness does not recall. This feeds into the cross-examiner’s argument that the witness cannot even remember facts that don’t support his opinion.]
Q. And do you recall reading Mr. Kitchen’s deposition in which he said that after 1991, Mr. Mead appeared withdrawn, when a person is defeated, your posture is not quite the same, he was a little beaten, do you remember that?
A. I do remember that, but it’s not — it’s my understanding that that was not described as a persistent or ongoing feature.
Q. It was described as his change in personality after 1991, wasn’t it?
A. Again I would apologize, I’d have to look at that and view it in context. I don’t recall that as being a persistent feature of Mr. Mead from that point on.
Q. Do you remember Mr. Kitchen saying that there was a possible change in his personality, Mr. Kitchen wasn’t sure, it might have always been there, but he started to notice that there was not a good two-way communication, it was difficult to communicate with Mr. Mead, do you recall that?
A. Again in the context of them telling him that they’re going to get rid of him, that’s understandable, but I really don’t recall that one way or the other.
Q. And do you recall Mr. Kitchen saying that he appeared depressed?
A. Again I recall that at a particular point in time, but not as an ongoing change or feature of Mr. Mead.
Q. Do you remember the partners and employees all saying that they would not be surprised if Mr. Mead had health problems and didn’t show or tell them about them?
A. I’d be glad to look at that, but I don’t recall that.
Q. Do you remember them saying he was a private person and that in this type of industry this is not the first thing you’d necessarily want out?
A. Again, I apologize. I don’t recall, but I’d be happy to look at it.
Q. Were you given Nancy McGinty’s deposition?
A. No.
[It’s a profitable line of questions to pursue all the evidence that had been withheld by opposing counsel from this expert.]
Q. So you haven’t heard that she knew him for ten years and always knew him to be a person of integrity, credibility, and honesty, is that right?
A. Actually, I did — I was told that she had testified that there was no evidence whatsoever he had any health problems or anything suggestive of CFS.
Q. That wasn’t my question. My question is, were you aware that she had testified that she knew him for ten years and always knew him to be a person of integrity, credibility, and honesty?
A. No, I hadn’t heard that.
Q. You’re dependent on all the information, and the only information you get is what the defense attorneys give you, is that right?
A. Well, in terms of the records and then, you know, it’s obviously — there’s an interplay because I require a certain number of appropriate records for me to do my work, and then there’s my own personal examination of Mr. Mead.
Q. In terms of information beyond your examination of Mr. Mead, you’re dependent upon the defense lawyers, aren’t you?
A. Again, as I say, I’m dependent on them providing it to me, but I’m also going to insist on a certain amount of information.
[The cross-examiner now echoes the witness’s language – “insist.” ]
Q. Did you insist on getting the depositions of the other employees who worked with Mr. Mead?
A. No, I didn’t.
Q. Okay, and in your opinion knowing that the jury has heard that she knew him for ten years and always knew him to be a person of integrity, credibility, and honesty, do you think that Nancy McGinty is lying about that?
A. If that’s what she said, I don’t have any reason to think that she’s lying about that.
Q. Do you think knowing him for ten years, she might know more about him than you do?
A. Given that his wife who lived with him didn’t know he was having an affair for years, I don’t think that’s necessarily the case. I think you have to look at all of the available information.
Q. Is this information that would be important to you —
A. Well —
Q. — what Nancy McGinty testified to?
A. It potentially could be, and again I’m always happy to consider it, but there’s always additional things that we can find, but again there’s overwhelming information for the position that supports my opinion.
Q. Nancy Buckley, were you given her deposition?
A. No.
Q. I’m sorry, Susan Buckley. And if she testified that in all of the years she’d known Mr. Mead from working with him at the partnership and knew him to be a person of integrity and an honest person, would that be important information?
A. Yes, I’d certainly consider that.
Q. You weren’t given that either, were you?
A. No.
Q. In fact, Mr. Kitchen testified that he thought the mistakes that — or the misjudgments — that Mr. Mead was making were honestly made and were not intentionally misleading, isn’t that right?
A. Yes.
Q. You’ve — by the way, you formed your opinion and wrote your report without ever having seen the deposition of Gena Mead, isn’t that right?
A. Yes, that’s correct.
Q. That’s not something you insisted on seeing before deciding that Mr. Mead was a liar and a malingerer?
A. Well, as I discussed with your associate in my deposition, I wasn’t even aware she had a deposition taken by then.
Q. What did Mrs. Mead say about his health and activities? Oh, have you been provided her deposition?
A. No.
Q. So you don’t know what she has to say about that?
A. With the exception of what I’ve heard about —
Q. From the defense lawyers?
A. — in her testimony here in trial, that’s correct.
Q. From the defense lawyers?
A. Yes.
Q. All right. Do you consider that an unbiased source of information?
[The lawyer continually gets interesting answers directly pushing the witness on bias issues.]
A. I would imagine what they were telling me about somebody — what somebody would say here in court, I would expect them to be honest and forthcoming about that.
Q. If Mrs. Mead testified to a deteriorating and difficult health condition, is she lying?
A. In her case I think there is a very strong possibility she is because it’s my understanding that she said what were bordered on ridiculous things when she testified about trying to justify their relationship or hide the relationship, so I would take that with a rather large grain of salt.
Q. Did they show you the claim file?
A. Well, I mean I certainly have some of my records which are listed in my report include what my understanding would be in a claim file. I don’t know if there are other things in the claim file.
Q. You have the records where Mr. Mead is saying to Paul Revere tell me what test to take and I’ll go take it?
A. I don’t know if I have that or not.
Q. Is that the sort of position you would expect a malingerer to take?
A. In somebody who does the kind of research that Mr. Mead does, I think that still would be very reasonable.
Q. By the way, since we’re on the subject of research, did you read his letters regarding Dr. Etcoff’s report?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you agree with his analysis?
A. No, I don’t in the most part, but I’m certainly impressed with him.
Q. He got it wrong, didn’t he?
A. Well, when you say “it,” I think we’d have to look at the available information, but in general it’s my understanding that they don’t properly understand what something like Dr. Etcoff’s testing involves.
Q. So Mr. Mead as he did this detailed sophisticated analysis that you were so impressed with actually was wrong, the analysis was flawed, wasn’t it?
A. That’s correct.
Q. Dr. Lees-Haley says that the MMPI testing is the gold standard for malingering, would you agree with that?
A. In terms of psychological tests, I would certainly agree with that.
Q. Well, I guess we’ve covered — you weren’t given Dr. Lees-Haley’s deposition, were you?
A. No, I wasn’t.
Q. In fact, Dr. Lees-Haley testified that Mr. Mead’s MMPI results showed the opposite of malingering, didn’t he?
A. Well, it’s my understanding that it showed another type of intentional distortion but in the opposite direction of exaggeration.
Q. What did Dr. Lees-Haley say? Turn to page 184 of his deposition, please. Didn’t he say at page — beginning of page 183 that the MMPI results of Mr. Mead were the opposite of malingering? .
A. Just give me one second. (Reading.) Yes, that he was distorting but in the opposite direction.
Q. Page 184, line 15, there’s nothing in your report of February 26, 2002, that states based on the MMPI-2 that I administered to Mr. Mead, I do not find that he was a malingerer, there is nothing here that states that, is there? Answer, yes, there is. I said he did just the opposite of that. He under reported. I just didn’t use the words you’re using. I made a very clear statement that he was doing just the opposite. Do you agree with that?
A. Yes, just as I said, that he was making an opposite type of distortion.
Q. And the MMPI is the most validated test, psychometric test, for the detection of malingering, isn’t it?
A. In terms of psychological tests, that’s correct, it is the gold standard.
Q. In fact, Dr. Reznick, the person you said is probably the foremost expert in psychiatric assessment specifically says that the MMPI-2 is the most validated psychometric test for evaluating suspected malingering, doesn’t he?
A. Yes, and I would certainly agree with that.
Q. All right, so the most validated psychometric test says not only is he not malingering, he’s doing the opposite of it, isn’t that right?
A. Well, again that is still an intentional distortion, but it’s in the other direction, that’s correct.
Q. One of the reasons you give for believing that Mr. Mead is a malingerer is that he refused to let you tape, isn’t that right?
A. Yes.
Q. And you wrote that in your report?
A. Yes.
Q. And you gave it to the defense lawyers?
A. Yes.
Q. And you told them you thought this was powerful evidence that he was malingering?
A. No, I don’t think that’s a fair characterization. Again I think it’s important to consider. It’s not powerful as though it’s going to make a decision one way or the other, but it’s important to consider.
Q. Didn’t you tell us today that it was powerful evidence in support of your opinion that he is malingering?
A. I would certainly agree that that as well as refusing to let me even use my laptop, the first in a thousand cases, I would say that is powerful, but it’s not like a diagnosis of malingering would hinge just on that.
Q. Did the defense lawyers then after receiving your report and hearing your opinions tell you that they were the ones who says there was not to be recordings of this session?
THE WITNESS: I never heard that.
Q. All right. Did they ever tell you that when these appointments were scheduled, Mr. Mead wanted to bring a witness because he was afraid of attending an IME, and he was told he could not bring a witness?
A. No, I didn’t hear that.
Q. Did they ever tell you that when they told him he couldn’t bring a witness, they also told him he couldn’t videotape the session?
A. No.
Q. Would that be important in interpreting his attitude when he shows up at his office having been told he can’t have a witness to see what you’re doing and he can’t record what you’re doing?
A. No, I wouldn’t think so because he could still audiotape it which is appropriate, and I also made it clear to him that he would certainly be entitled to a copy of the audiotape. I go through the same thing with all of the people I interview. They usually bring their own taping equipment or overwhelmingly agree to taping.
Q. Let me hand you what’s been marked as Exhibit 222. They never showed you this letter they wrote to Mr. Mead’s attorneys in which they said, finally it is our understanding that Mr. Mead does not intend to and will not videotape either evaluation and will not attempt to bring any witnesses to observe either evaluation. Is that right?
A. No, I don’t believe I’ve seen this.
Q. All right. Would you have allowed him to videotape the deposition?
A. No, I would have objected to that, but I certainly would have encouraged him to audiotape the evaluation.
Q. Do you know why they didn’t want anybody to see what you were going to do in that evaluation?
A. Well, I’m not a lawyer, but from doing this so many times, I know that legally he’s not entitled to have somebody in the room, and the only benefit to it is that that person can cue him or coach him. So audio taping is the standard, and in California he legally cannot audiotape — I mean he legally cannot have somebody present.
Q. And you’re not privy to the conversations that took place between the lawyers what Mr. Mead’s lawyer may have instructed him after receiving this letter, are you?
A. No, and he certainly mentioned nothing about it at all while we went around and around about this.
Q. Actually, Dr. Rosenberg, didn’t he tell you that he had been told he couldn’t tape and, therefore, he didn’t want you to be taping, isn’t that what he told you?
A. He certainly did not say he’d been told he couldn’t audiotape. I don’t recall if he was told he couldn’t videotape.
Q. Well, Mr. McKennon or the defense lawyers gave you Dr. Cusher’s deposition, correct? Here’s what I’d like to do, if we can, because we’re running out of time. I would like to go through quickly what you were given and what you weren’t given, all right?
A. Okay.
Q. You have your report there, so you have a list of what you were given?
A. Yes.
Q. You were given Dr. Cusher’s deposition, correct, he is the in-house doctor for Paul Revere?
A. Yes, I was.
Q. You were given Dr. Anderson’s deposition, is that correct?
A. I believe at some point after I furnished my report, I believe I did.
Q. Were you given the Connecticut Licensing Board’s sanction of Dr. Anderson for writing himself narcotic prescriptions?
A. I was aware that he had a problem with the licensing board. I don’t — I wasn’t given anything in writing I don’t believe.
Q. Did they give you Dr. Goldstein’s, he’s the in-house doctor, a review of Dr. Donaldson?
A. I apologize. I don’t recall.
Q. Did they give you Dr. Rapoport’s deposition?
A. No.
Q. Dr. Silber’s deposition?
A. No.
Q. Any of the Mayo Clinic depositions?
A. No.
Q. Your opinion is only as good as the information you’re given, isn’t that right?
A. Well, as good as the information given and as good as my expertise and how I apply it.
Q. Exactly. Did they give you Dr. Epstein’s deposition?
A. No.
Q. Dr. Epstein — I’m sorry, Dr. Iznik’s deposition?
A. No.
Q. Dr. Squires deposition?
A. No.
Q. Dr. Sandman’s deposition?
A. No.
Q. We already discussed Mrs. Mead’s deposition, they didn’t give you that, they didn’t give you the two employees’ depositions, is that right?
A. That’s all correct.
Q. Did they give you Dr. Seggev’s records at all?
A. Doctor who?
Q. Seggev.
A. No.
Q. Did they give you Dr. Conley’s records?
A. His records?
Q. Yes.
A. Well, I mentioned earlier a letter by Dr. Conley, I don’t recall if I have other records or not.
Q. All right. That’s what is called cherry picking, isn’t it, when you take some things out of the records, but don’t give the rest, you’ve heard that term before?
A. Well, I don’t know if that necessarily applies in this case. I certainly have heard the term.
Q. Do malingers ordinarily hide the problems they’re trying to malinger from the people around them?
A. Well, it depends on what type of problems you’re talking about and what type of malingering you’re talking about.
Q. I’m talking about health problems, malingering health problems, do people who are trying to malinger health problems normally try to keep those secret from the people around them?
A. Well, in Mr. Mead’s case there would be a reasonable explanation for that.
Q. Yes, there would. Do people who are malingering health problems ordinarily put forth great effort and do well on physical testing?
A. Again it would depend on the type of malingering and the type of health problem we’re talking about.
Q. Well, you know what we’re talking about, don’t you? You know that the medical records show that every time he was given a physical test, he worked hard and did well on it, you know that, don’t you?
A. With the exception of Dr. Cheney’s fourth bike ergometry, that is my understanding.
Q. All right, and is that what you’d expect to see with a malingerer who is trying to malinger fatigue, muscle soreness?
A. Potentially given the other aspects of his claim, that doesn’t negate the CFS claim he was putting together.
Q. And so he’s claiming fatigue and muscle soreness and he’s doing well on physical tests, couldn’t that suggest to you, Dr. Rosenberg, that he’s a sick man who is also very proud and competitive, and he is working hard on these physical tests?
A. Well, given all the other distortions around the same time, I think the fact that he did well on a test that’s not central to the diagnosis of CFS really wouldn’t change my opinion.
Q. I think you testified, or maybe it’s in your report, that he showed remarkable stamina in his meetings with you and Dr. Lees-Haley, is that right?
A. Yes.
Q. And is that what somebody does when they’re malingering?
A. It certainly can be what somebody does. Oftentimes the individual won’t realize that he or she is putting together a faked claim and that something like that would be detected just like Mr. Mead’s depositions. You know, he does very well in his depositions and doesn’t realize that they show very strong cognitive functioning.
Q. So he’s smart enough to study up on these tests, he’s smart enough to write sophisticated letters, but he’s not smart enough to know that when he goes to an IME exam that he should try to look tired?
A. I think that’s certainly possible. He would say at times he’s tired, but he also wanted to get through it and would refuse breaks.
Q. In fact, didn’t Dr. Lees-Haley find — didn’t Dr. Lees-Haley find that he was fatigued during his meeting, or didn’t Dr. Lees-Haley say he appeared fatigued during his meeting with Dr. Lees-Haley?
A. Yes, I believe he did.
Q. So why did you tell us this morning that he attended both yours and Dr. Lees-Haley’s sessions and showed no sign of fatigue?
A. Well, because again what I said stands exactly as I put it. There was no sign of problems with fatigue. Signs referred to observable evidence, and it is unusual for somebody even without CFS or the average person to go that many hours and not ask for a break or several breaks, and so he can say he’s tired just like he can say he has this or that problem, but his observable stamina is that he went through both examinations refusing breaks repeatedly.
Q. Well, Dr. Lees-Haley specifically said that he appeared — Mr. Mead appeared fatigued, do you recall — well, you’ve already said you recall that. Let me move on. Do you recall that Dr. Gardner testified that he did not doubt Mr. Mead’s credibility with regard to his symptoms?
A. I don’t. I don’t recall one way or the other.
Q. Let me just show you this on the screen. It’s from page 87 of Dr. Gardner’s deposition. He’s asked, did your impression that he didn’t open up, did that cause you to question his credibility regarding his objective complaints at all? No. Question, do you have any reason to question his credibility with regard to his subjective complaints? No. Is that what Dr. Gardner testified to?
A. I don’t recall if he did or not. I’ll certainly accept it if that’s your representation.
Q. Is there anything, Dr. Rosenberg, that anybody could say that would cause you to change your opinion that Mr. Mead is a liar and a fraud?
A. Sure, there would be a variety of things. If there were, for example, evidence from a — you know, it’s tough now because he’s taken it so many times. He’s done so much research. For example, if there was neuropsychological testing that showed in an incredible way the types of deficits we’re talking about, that would be one thing, although again it has to be weighed against all of these other things. You know, if we could turn back the clock, and there was evidence of it actually affecting his function, if he didn’t go to all that length to analyze the neuropsych testing in a sophisticated way, there are lots of things that if we turn back the clock and he did differently or the results came out differently, I would have a completely different opinion.
Q. It’s not unusual for patients to read up on whatever condition they have, is it?
A. Well, that’s very different from what he did, but certainly patients do that.
Q. And there’s nothing sinister about that, is there?
A. What patients normally do? No.
Q. Dr. Rosenberg, just to be clear, your opinion is that all the treating doctors got it wrong, is that correct?
A. Well, I don’t think we make that broad of a statement, but any treating doctor who asserts that Mr. Mead does have chronic fatigue syndrome and it impairs his ability to function, with all due respect I think that’s incorrect.
Q. He fooled them all?
A. Well, in the manner I just described it to you, that would be correct.
MR. FRIEDMAN: Thank you, Dr. Rosenberg.
[The cross-examination ends strongly, with the witness polarized to an extreme view that every treating doctor got it wrong. The wrapup questions also made good use of the witness not having seen a number of relevant records, supporting the cherry-picking theme.]
Q Mr. Stephens, your deposition was taken in this case in November of last year. Do you recall that?
[Unlike a non-party witness, the deposition of a corporate spokesman can be used for any purpose, so it’s unobjectionable for the cross-examiner to lead with what at first looks like the setup for reading testimony as non-impeachment substantive admissions. Instead, the cross-examiner uses the deposition as a reminder to the witness that he needs to toe the line of what he already said.]
A Yes, I do.
Q And you were provided by STN at that time as the person who was most knowledgeable in the hiring practices and procedures at Sugar Transport and specifically regarding the hiring of Jose Carcamo. Do you recall that?
A Yes, I do.
Q And you realized, at the time your deposition was taken, you were under oath?
A Yes.
Q Okay. And after your deposition was taken, you didn’t make any changes to it, and you signed it?
A There was one change that I made. It was the actual number of years that I worked for the company. And then I signed it, yes.
Q All right. And you’ve worked for STN for over 20 years?
A Yes, sir.
Q Now, you are the terminal manager for the southern element of STN, correct?
A I am the terminal manager for the Northern and Southern California depots.
Q Where do you live, sir?
A I live in Atwater.
Q And for us Southern Californians, where is that?
A Atwater is just north of Merced, south of Modesto.
Q And how far away from the Southgate terminal is that?
A 300 miles, 300-plus miles.
Q And so, it’s your testimony that you oversee the hiring of not just the people up in Stockton, but also the people down in Southgate; is that right? The drivers?
A I don’t hire anyone in Stockton.
Q Okay. You hire people in what plant?
A At the Broncho wine facility, where we are stationed, and in Southern California, yes.
Q And what operations do you have in Stockton where you live?
A I don’t live in Stockton.
Q What operations do you have in Northern California?
A Cherokee Freight Lines is in Stockton, California.
Q Are you an employee of Cherokee Freight Lines?
A No, I am not.
Q Do you work for Cherokee Freight Lines?
A No, I do not.
Q Okay. So, am I understanding that you are the terminal manager for Southgate, and you live up in Atwater?
A That’s correct.
Q And you don’t do any work for any of the operations up in Northern California of STN?
A I am in charge of Northern California Sugar Transport stationed in Ceres, California.
Q Okay. Where is Sugar Transport’s Northern operation?
A The ownership is in Stockton, California. We are based out of the Broncho Winery in Ceres, California. We are stationed at the Broncho Winery in Ceres, California.
Q And where is Ceres in relationship to Southgate?
A It’s in Northern California.
Q How many miles from Southgate?
A 300-plus miles.
Q So, your home is close to your operation up north?
A That is correct.
Q And how many drivers do you have in the Northern operation?
A 21.
Q And how many in the southern operation?
A 16.
Q And you were the person that was provided as the person who had knowledge of the hiring, specifically, of Jose Carcamo; is that right?
A That’s correct.
Q Now, you have no memory of having interviewed Jose Carcamo; is that right?
A That is correct.
Q And you have no recollection of obtaining the information that was obtained from past employers for Jose Carcamo until just before your deposition was taken; isn’t that right?
A Yes, it is.
Q And the reason for that is because there’s no policy for the person who’s going to be—at STN, for the person who is going to hire the driver to see the documents that are returned from the prior employers; isn’t that right?
A That is correct.
[The questioner next poses a common-sense Rule of the Road question, oriented toward public safety.]
Q Do you believe, sir, as a—as the person in charge of hiring for STN, that before hiring someone or at the time you get the information back from the prior employers, you should take that into consideration in determining whether they are a safe or unsafe driver to protect the public on the motoring—motoring public?
A I believe it could be one consideration, yes.
Q And that—and at STN, it can’t be a consideration because you don’t get the information; isn’t that right?
A That is correct.
Q How many years have you been in charge of hiring for STN?
A It has to be in the 15 neighborhood, 14-15 years.
Q And for the past 14 or 15 years, as the hiring manager in charge of hiring at STN, you have never seen one of those previous employer’s records like you got on Jose Carcamo; isn’t that correct?
A That is correct.
Q So, it isn’t just a situation where you didn’t see it for Jose Carcamo. The policy and procedures set up at STN are set up so that the person who hires the drivers never sees the information that’s returned from the prior employers; is that right?
[The cross-examiner sets up the problem as not just leading to the issue for this driver, but systemic to the defendant company.]
A That is correct.
Q And you didn’t interview Jose Carcamo, did you?
A Looking back on it, no.
Q But you made the final decision to hire him?
A Yes, I did.
Q Do you remember that decision?
A Not specifically.
Q But when you made the decision, you clearly didn’t have any information that came from prior employers because that’s not the policy at STN, correct?
A That’s correct.
Q Now, right before your deposition, I take it your—the lawyer for STN showed you this document, which is 81. Smaller version?
A Yes.
Q And, of course, that document, Plaintiff’s 81, wasn’t even considered when you decided to hire Jose Carcamo because you don’t get it; is that right?
A I did not get that.
Q And you saw on that, sir, that basically, that document, which you didn’t have, gets told—said that the safety habits of Jose Carcamo were poor and that he had two accidents, correct?
A Yes, it is.
Q And we asked you why you would hire someone if you had that kind of information, and you told us, “It’s hard to find drivers where their DMV printout are not a deterrent, and we needed drivers, we needed bodies to work.” Was that your testimony back then?
A Yes, it was.
[This was a great admission, which, since it came in a party’s deposition, through its corporate spokesman, could be read into the record as substantive evidence without trying to first set up a contradiction.]
Q Do you know why the federal government has set up a practice and procedure for the hiring of commercial drivers?
A I would say so that they can regulate us.
Q So they can regulate you to make sure that you hire safe drivers to protect the rest of the people that are driving on the freeways; is that right?
A Yes.
Q Do you think it’s a valid reason, when you only know one thing from somebody, and that is that they are—have poor safety habits, do you think it’s a valid reason for STN to say we need to hire him because we need to put drivers out on the road?
A On one man’s judgment?
Q I’m asking you. You are the guy who is in charge of hiring.
A On one man’s judgment, I wouldn’t take that to heart.
Q I asked you, do you think that if you get a report, the only report, that says driving—or safety habits were poor, and he had two accidents, that it’s a valid excuse to hire him because you need to put drivers out there on the road so STN can make some money? Do you think that’s a reasonable excuse?
A No.
Q So you agree with me, sir, then, that with that information, you shouldn’t have hired him?
A No.
MR. RENNIE: Judge, I think we have one of those double-negative questions you usually try to flush out.
MR. GRASSINI: Let me ask it to you so it’s not—Do you believe that with that information, and that’s all the information you had, that it was a valid excuse that you needed to fill your slots for drivers? That’s a that’s a yes or no.
A That’s the only piece of paper that I have to work with, sir.
Q That’s the only piece of paper you got; is that right?
A If that’s the only piece of paper I have to work with, then you are right.
Q Okay. Now, there are ways to get more information, aren’t there?
A Yes.
Q And you said in your deposition that if you had three or four of those, then maybe you wouldn’t hire him?
A That is correct.
Q Now, have you reviewed Carcamo’s driver qualification file since your deposition or before your deposition or any time?
A No.
Q As the person most knowledgeable on the hiring practices and specifically the hiring of Jose Carcamo, you’ve not looked at his driver qualification file?
A I’ve seen his DMV printout from when he handed it to us, when he turned that in. His resume.
Q Well, could you show me in his personnel and driver qualification file where the resume is?
A I don’t know if we kept it or not. Sir, this is the first time –
THE COURT: Counsel, you’ve asked him to look for it.
MR. GRASSINI: Fine. See if you can find that. The resume you are looking for.
A I don’t see it in here.
Q Did you know that STN sent out documents, sent out requests for employment verification from the three or four prior employers that Carcamo had listed on his application?
A I would assume that we did, yes.
Q As the person most knowledgeable, did you know that they did?
A No, I don’t know that they did.
Q Do you know, as the person most knowledgeable, what they did to make any good faith effort to get information from the prior employers that didn’t return the request?
A No, I don’t.
Q Do you believe, as the person most knowledgeable about the hiring practices and procedures at STN, that if STN sends out employment verification requests and doesn’t get anything back, that they should make a good faith effort to follow up and try and get some information?
A Yes.
Q Do you know why they didn’t?
A No.
Q Well, you were the man in charge. Weren’t you the one who should have done it?
A No. I wasn’t in—I did not fill out or send out any of that paperwork.
Q Now, if you had seen any of the information for the person that you are most knowledgeable about hiring and it hadn’t come back, but you had his employment application, okay?
A Okay.
Q That’s the employment application, correct?
A Yes, it is.
Q First time you’ve seen it?
A No.
Q Showed it to you before at your deposition?
A Yes.
Q Which was in November of 2007, two and a half years after he was hired, correct?
A Yes.
Q When you look at that employment application, do you see that he worked for three months immediately before he applied to you, for Southwest Processors?
A Yes.
Q And Southwest Processors is the one who said they wouldn’t re-hire him and he had poor safety habits. The next note shows that he had a gap in his driving from February of ‘05 for four years. Do you see that?
A Yes.
Q As a person provided as the person most knowledgeable in the hiring of employees at STN and specifically Jose Carcamo, isn’t that a red flag?
A No.
Q Is a gap in the employment history something that gets your attention?
A We ask them about the, uhm—yes, it gets our attention.
Q And you ask them what they were doing during the time there was the gap?
A Yes.
Q And do you know if that was done in this case?
A I could not tell you.
Q And then you didn’t see the application; so, you, yourself, could not determine there was this four-year gap from the three months before he was hired, right?
A That’s correct.
Q Now I want to talk to you about the STN safety and training manual. You’ve seen that?
A Yes, I have.
Q You are familiar with it?
A Not familiar with it.
Q Well, you are the person who hires people for STN, aren’t you?
[It’s useful to keep reminding the jury that this is a witness who should know things he doesn’t know.]
A Yes, I am.
Q Do you think that the people that you hire for STN should become familiar with your own safety manual?
A There are—yes.
Q And how can they do that if you are not familiar with it?
A I’ve worked for the company for 20 years. I have long since forgotten most of that.
Q But you are in charge of hiring and firing. Do you think that you should be familiar with it, number one, and number two, give it to the employees so they can become familiar with it?
A We—it is given to the employees.
Q Do you know in Mr. Carcamo’s deposition he testified no one gave it to him?
A No, I didn’t know that.
Q Assume for me that he did testify that he wasn’t given the STN safety and training manual. That would be a violation of your—of your policies, wouldn’t it, to give the employees a copy of the manual?
A It would be a violation, yes.
Q And it says you don’t have a copy. Let me put it in front of you, sir. Sir, have you seen that in your manual?
A I haven’t seen that, but it’s there.
Q And that’s regarding training, correct?
A Yes.
Q And that talks about STN’s training policies, correct? And it says: “At the time of hire, an extensive orientation program and review of the safety and training manual take place. We hold ongoing safety meetings, which are mandatory to attend.” Do you know if any kind of an orientation program was given to Jose Carcamo, including a review of this safety manual, before you put him out on the road?
A No, I don’t.
Q Referring again to Exhibit 6, line No. 8, page 8. You see that the manual says: “Safety meetings are held on Saturday or Sunday several times throughout the year. Employees are required to attend?”
A Yes
Q Do you know—and when they are—when they attend, don’t you put something in their file about them attending safety meetings?
A Yes, there would be something.
Q Okay. As you looked through the file of Jose Carcamo, did you see any indication that he’s ever attended any safety meeting?
A No.
Q And am I correct, sir, that when you hire drivers, you hire them for the first 120 days as an introductory period in order to evaluate their performance and to get the information back from prior employers?
A Yes.
Q And during that time, they are probationary employees. They don’t get medical coverage, they don’t get holiday plans or anything like that, they are just probationary employees, correct?
A Yes.
Q And is the reason for that, sir, that in the event you get something like this back, referring to Exhibit 81, you can decide whether or not you want to keep them?
A Yes.
Q Do you have a policy, sir, when someone has an accident on the job, to come down and talk to them about that accident?
A No, I don’t.
Q Does STN?
A I am not aware of one. I’m not the safety officer.
Q Who is the safety officer?
A That would be John Ott.
Q Now, you know what a tachograph is, don’t you?
A Yes.
Q And you are the fellow from STN that described it in your deposition as a tattletale; is that right?
A That’s correct.
Q And by tattletale, one of the things that you mean is that if someone’s involved in an accident, and they are speeding, or they have an impact, the tachograph will be the tattletale; isn’t that right?
A No.
Q Did you have any knowledge, sir, as the—you are not the safety person, are you?
A No. ,
Q You are the hiring person?
A Yes.
Q You’ve seen tachographs for years?
A Yes.
Q And are you aware, sir, that tachographs show accident circumstances?
A No, I am not aware of that.
Q You just were never aware of that?
A Yes, that’s correct.
Q Let me ask you, sir, have you ever seen the owner’s manual that comes with the Abbott tachograph?
A No, I haven’t.
[The cross-examiner launches a line of questions that show the witness should know something he claims not to know.]
Q How do you know that? I didn’t even get it in front of you. How do you know you’ve never seen that?
A I’ve never seen it.
Q Have you tried to keep yourself from seeing it?
A No.
Q Have you ever asked for it?
A No.
Q Have you ever wondered what it was that those tachographs were doing in your trucks for the people that you hired?
A No.
Q But you don’t do—do know that STN was requiring the drivers to sign the tachographs every morning?
A Yes.
Q Put them in their trucks and then hand them in at the end of night, don’t you?
A Yes.
Q And that those trucks at STN that had tachographs, the tachographs were used by the drivers?
A Yes.
Q As the, uhm, person most knowledgeable in hiring, are you aware, sir, of the requirements of the federal government to keep duty hours?
A Yes and no. I am not—I don’t watch them.
Q You understand that there are requirements for your drivers that they can only drive so many hours per day, and they can only drive so many hours per week, you know that?
A Yes.
Q Okay. And you discuss that with them, don’t you?
A If I am made aware that there’s a problem, then I will discuss it with the drivers, yes.
Q Who discusses it with them if there’s no problem so they know what they are supposed to do?
A John Ott.
Q John Ott is up there with you in Ceres, isn’t he?
A Stockton.
Q Stockton?
A Yes.
Q You know he never came down and talked to Jose Carcamo before he was employed, don’t you?
A I am not aware of it, but I couldn’t tell you for sure.
Q Well, you’ve been sitting out here in the hallway here for two or three days sitting there next to John Ott?
A Yes.
Q And you never asked him whether or not he ever came down and talked to Mr. Carcamo before Mr. Carcamo was employed?
A No.
Q I want to show you a—a document, sir, and we will mark this next in order. This was in your deposition. Are you aware, sir, that that note was found in the glove compartment of the of the vehicle that Carcamo was driving at the time of the accident?
A I was told that, yes.
Q Okay. And is it STN policy to tell their drivers what to do in the case of an accident?
A Yes.
Q And so, that’s standard policy for STN to have something—some—a note like that or that one in their glove—glove box at all times, correct?
A Something that they can refer to, yes.
Q Okay. And that—and that’s actually a picture of the—the note that was in the glove box, correct?
A That’s suppose—yes.
Q And it says: “Attention drivers, These forms must be in every truck as well as a camera to get pictures of all pertinent information if involved in an accident or any situation where photos can help you or the company; parking tickets, citations, et cetera.” Do you see that?
A Yes.
Q Okay. So, somebody had to have some discussions with the truck drivers about what they should do in the event of an accident, right?
A Yes.
Q And they are told specifically that they should get pictures in a situation where the photos can help you and the company, right?
A That’s correct.
Q Okay. And are you aware, sir, of when those notes were put into the driver’s glove box, whether there was any mention to them about how the tachograph, if they are involved in an accident, can show the accident sequence?
A No.
Q You are not—you are not aware of that?
A No. I am not aware of that.
Q Who would be aware of that? Mr. Ott?
A That’s a possibility.
Q Now, you do know—maybe you don’t. Let me show you the safety and training manual 8-1. And you see that shows the accident reporting procedures?
A Yes.
Q And it says: “Do not admit liability to anyone”?
A Yes, it does.
Q Okay. When somebody discusses that part of the manual with the prospective drivers, do they at that point say anything to them about the tachograph?
A No.
Q They don’t?
A I would assume not. No. There’s probably no mention of the tachographs.
Q You are aware the manual says to fill out the tachographs every day?
A If it’s the old manual, yes.
Q Well, you are—the old manual is the manual, the only manual that’s ever been produced to us. It was updated in 1998, and the tachograph in this case was installed after 2003. Anything old about that?
A No.
Q Now, when we took your deposition, had you read the deposition of Jose Carcamo?
A No.
Q Have you read it up to today?
A No.
Q Do you know that in the—and the jury has seen the deposition. In the deposition, Mr. Carcamo admitted that he lied on his application because it was the best he could do.
A I am not aware of that.
Q You weren’t aware of it at your deposition, not aware of it now?
A You are telling me this now? Yes.
Q We asked you at your deposition, didn’t we, if you knew that Jose Carcamo had admitted that he was untruthful in his application?
A Yes, you did mention that.
Q And we asked you if you were aware of it, and you said you weren’t. Do you think, as the person most knowledgeable in the hiring and retention of Jose Carcamo, that might be something you would want to take a look at before you came in here and testified to this jury?
A I wasn’t aware I could read the other people’s depositions.
Q So, it’s your testimony that you would have read the deposition of Jose Carcamo, but your lawyers told you you couldn’t?
A I didn’t ask, nor did anyone tell me.
Q You’ve been sitting out there two or three days. You could have sat and read Jose Carcamo’s deposition, and you didn’t do it?
A That’s correct.
Q Sir, when you are provided as the person who is most knowledgeable as to the hiring and retention of Jose Carcamo, don’t you think it’s important, before you come before this jury, to read what he said about his hiring?
A I wasn’t made of aware of them.
Q You did the performance review of Jose Carcamo; is that correct?
A That’s correct.
Q Have you ever met him?
A Yes.
Q When?
A Oh, jeez. Uhm, I really don’t remember the date. Back in 2005.
Q How many times have you talked to him since you first met him?
A I have no way of telling you that. I don’t have any idea.
Q How often do you come down to Southern California?
A I’m usually in Southern California every couple of months.
Q Every couple of months. And it was your job to do the performance evaluation of Jose Carcamo; is that right?
A That’s correct.
Q That’s based upon every couple of months? Perhaps seeing him, seeing how he’s working, seeing how he’s driving, is that how you do it?
A Yes.
Q But your performance evaluation of Mr. Carcamo was that he was harsh and condescending towards others; isn’t that right?
A Yes.
Q And he has an anger problem, doesn’t he?
A I don’t believe I wrote “anger problem.”
Q Well, do you believe he has an anger problem?
A I don’t think he has an anger problem.
Q Well, what do you say—what does “harsh, condescending, and a problem with authority figures” mean to you?
A The—the way that he talked to the authority figures, uhm, the fact that occasionally, when he was dealing with the customer service personnel, he was uhm, sharp with them.
Q Let me ask you, sir, do you know, as the person who is in charge of hiring drivers, are you a driver yourself?
A I have been, yes.
Q Are you a driver now?
A I have a commercial license.
Q Do you—do you drive?
A No.
Q Have you—are you familiar with the truck drivers’ handbook?
A Yes.
Q And do you know that in the truck drivers’ handbook there’s a discussion in there about, uhm, not speeding up to keep people from cutting in front of you?
A I am sure there’s something in there. I am not familiar with it, but that makes sense.
Q Because you know that’s a problem sometimes with truck drivers, isn’t it, that they get frustrated and that they—when people try to move in front of them, they move up to close the gap so the person can’t get into the lane? You know that’s a problem, don’t you?
A It’s a big problem throughout the—throughout—everyone that drives.
MR GRASSINI: Thank you. That’s all I have for you, sir.
[The cross ends on the plaintiff’s theory of the case, that a driver with a poor driving history and an anger management problem likely sped up to try to prevent another vehicle from moving into his lane. Before that, the cross-examination had effectively exposed the company’s indifference to its drivers’ work histories and its lackadaisical approach to its safety manual. The entire plaintiff’s case ends up proven through one adverse witnes
Q. Your focus is safety 100 percent?
A. (Witness nodding head.)
Q. And because safety is very important of the vessel; is that right?
A. For sure.
Q. It can be very dangerous working offshore, true?
A. Yeah.
Q. And because of that there’s all sorts of safety rules that Cal Dive has that are important; is that right?
A. They are, sir.
Q. And Cal Dive has a pretty lengthy safety rule book; is that right?
A. Yeah. They have a — like a Safety Management System that– that is quite extensive.
Q. And the reason is — if you go to page 286 — Cal Dive has a vision of people going home safely. And I think you and I can agree not only people going home safely but people going home healthy, fair?
A. Couldn’t agree with you more.
**
Q. (MR. ITKIN) And there is a section on conducting the formal investigation. And it says kind of in the middle of that first paragraph: A formal investigation shall be thorough and conscientious. Do you see that?
A. Yeah.
Q. And you agree — I mean, put aside you are not a paperwork guy. Even though you are in court with your suit on and everything, I hear you. You agree with that just in general principle?
A. Yeah. That is the guideline, yeah.
Q. Do it thorough as you can?
A. Okay.
Q. Be as accurate as you can?
A. “Nodding head.”
Q. Is that right?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. One of the things that Cal Dive wants you to do as part of your job is to interview the people involved, right?
A. Yeah.
Q. And what they want you to do is take complete notes of what each person says. Do you agree, right?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. Okay. That’s what it says right there in Part B. I am not making this up.
A. Right.

**
Q. So, where it says here take complete notes of what each person says you didn’t do that?
A. By the book, no.
Q. Okay. I mean, because if we go to the next page, it says: After the interview of each witness, write the interview summary of each person interviewed. Report what the person said in the interview using as many of the interviewed person’s words as possible. Do you see that?
A. Okay.
Q. Didn’t do that because you didn’t take notes to go put the summary together, fair?
A. Yeah. And that is quite often the case.
**
Q. Okay. I want to make a little timeline.
A. Okay.
Q. I think it is pretty much undisputed — you can tell me if I am wrong — but 8:15 in the morning is when the fall happens, right?
A. Okay.
**
Q. It could have been 8:45 that you interviewed him. It could have been sometime after 11:00, right?
A. Possibly.
Q. You don’t remember when?
A. No, I don’t.

[The cross-examiner then shows the witness the photographs the witness attached to his accident report of the scene of the fall, which he took after speaking to the injured man. On the side of one photo, the witness confirms one can see the edge of a power washer and water hose sitting on the deck at the scene of the accident. The cross-examiner proceeds to the $64,000 question.]

Q. Sir, is it your testimony — can you tell us for a fact —
A. Yes, sir.
Q. — can you tell us for a fact under oath here today in court that after Nigel’s fall nobody came to use that hose and that power washer to clean that area?
A. Afterwards?
Q. Uh-huh.
A. I can tell you that 100 percent, sir.
Q. You can?
A. Yeah.

[Many cross-examiners would have wilted with this last answer. But since it doesn’t fit the timeline, and the cross-examiner will later bring out how the investigator failed to interview any of the relevant witnesses, the lawyer plunges ahead. Before he repeats the question, he salts in some quick background on the timeline.]

Q. Even though the fall happened at 8:15?
A. Yeah.
Q. He saw the medic from 8:20 to 8:40?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. You didn’t interview him for almost three hours later?
A. Possibly.
Q. And you can tell us one 100 percent for a fact that nobody used that power washer?
A. No. I can’t tell you that. Nobody did. I suppose — excuse me. I will take that back. But from me to check the area and to say that there was oil there and somebody suggested that somebody cleaned it, I would say no. 100 percent that that happened, I can’t say that.
Q. There is slick spot of oil there —
A. Yeah.
Q. — and someone saw it, they should clean it up, right?
A. Yeah. Sure.
Q. Okay. Right?
A. Uh-huh.
Q. One of the things you can use to clean a deck with is a hose, true?
A. You can.
Q. Power washer, true?
A. Yeah.
[This next question is safe because the report has no interview notes attached to it.]

Q. Okay. Did you interview anyone as part of your formal investigation report to see if the water that you found on — the clean water that you found on that deck came from a power washer?
A. No, sir.
Q. Okay. Did you ask [the plaintiff] where he thought the oil came from?
A. No.
Q. Did you ask him if anyone else had reported the oil?
A. No.
Q. Did you ask him if anyone else had complained about the oil?
A. No.
Q. Did you ask him if there were any other witnesses?
A. No, sir.
Q. Did you interview anybody else?
A. No, sir.
[Next is a “stretch” question that underlines the point about the lack of interviews by the investigator.]

Q. Did you talk to anybody else about it?
A. No.
Q. How many incident reports have you filled out in the course of your career?
A. Many.
Q. Okay. And when you do it, do you also do them with the same thoroughness that you did Mr. Bryant’s injury report?
A. Well, thoroughness, you know, you look at who is in the area. You have a — you know, debrief and talk about it toil what that next day. You know, there is a black and white. Look at it but also, you know, there is a — you know, people come to you. You know, and Nigel Bryant [the injured man] would have had many friends on there that would have come forward. That is generally how I get all my information. You look at people coming in and helping. You know, you chat to people. You get a feel. But people would say I cleaned that up. I used that power washer. That is kind of how it works.
Q. Hold on a second. Did you go ask anyone if they used the power washer?
A. No.
Q. Do you have any logbook that says when people use the power washer?
A. No. Not at all.
Q. Okay. Are there certain people that use the power washer as part of their job?
A. Yeah. I mean, ABs.
Q. ABs?
A. Able-bodied seaman.
Q. How many ABs did you have on duty between 8:15 a.m. and 11:02?
A. There’s generally four on shift.

[Remember, the cross-examiner has already established that the investigator interviewed no one. So drilling down on specifics of whom he failed to interview on whether or not the deck was washed before he got there underscores how the witness cannot prove no washing occurred.]

Q. Okay. Did you talk to any of those four about the power washer?
A. No. Not at the time, no.
[Good listening by the cross-examiner, and a nice followup.]
Q. Okay. Have you talked to any of those four at any time?
A. About this incident?
Q. Yes.
A. No, sir.
Q. Okay. Did you talk to Nigel’s supervisor?
A. No.
Q. Did you talk to Nigel’s co-workers?
A. No.
Q. Did you talk to anyone besides the medic?
A. No. I didn’t. I spoke to Nigel Bryant and the medic.
**
Q. Okay. You never gave Nigel a copy of your accident report, did you?
A. No, sir.
Q. Our page 59 this is from Claims here in the middle from Mr. Shields. It says:
We won’t be providing a copy of the incident report to Nigel. He can have a summary. Is that right? You weren’t involved in that?
A. That is way above me, sir.

[The questioner shifts to some quick Rules agreement questions on the defendant’s responsibility.]

Q. Okay. Sir, if someone gets hurt on a Cal Dive vessel —
A. Yes.
Q. — and it is Cal Dive’s fault, you think that Cal Dive should take responsibility?
A. Yes, I do. Yeah.
Q. And I want to know what “responsibility” means to you because you have got — you have got people’s safety in your hands. Okay. Someone gets hurt on a Cal Dive vessel and it is Cal Dive’s fault, should they take care of the man’s wages while he — if he can’t go back to work?
A. I mean, lots of things that are applicable. If he got hurt on a vessel, yeah.
Q. They should?
A. Yeah.
Q. If he got medical costs and he got hurt on a vessel, Cal Dive — part of taking responsibility takes care of those medical costs, true?
A. It is not something I get involved in, but I would like to think so —
Q. Okay.
A. — under the right circumstances.
Q. Someone gets hurt on a Cal Dive vessel, Cal Dive should generally try to make it right, fair?
A. Yeah. Agree with all of that.
MR. ITKIN: Pass the witness, your Honor.
Q Good morning, Doctor. My name is Randy Kinnard, and I represent Bette and Ben Donathan.
A Yes.
Q We haven’t met before, have we?
A No, sir.
Q I notice defense counsel referred to April 16th as Easter Sunday. You were born in 1962?
A Yes, sir.
Q When you were six, I was in Vietnam. Okay?
A (Witness moves head up and down.)
Q We had New Years Day, Easter, July 4th, Thanksgiving, Christmas Day. We were in the jungle fighting the enemy. Do you think we let our guard down on Easter?
A No.
[A quick slice of personal biography can work well to connect cross-examiner to jury. It might be technically objectionable, because counsel is arguably “testifying” about his own personal experiences, but it works here because it happens fast and is immediately linked to a relevant bit of the witness’s testimony.]
Q You’re right. In your profession, not only in your profession, but there are a lot of professions where people have to work on holidays. True?
A Yes.
Q Firemen, policemen, pilots, air traffic controllers, all kinds of people have to work on the holidays, don’t they?
A Yes.
[A good cross-examiner like Kinnard instinctively looks for ways to broaden the point from the profession in the trial spotlight, medicine, to more familiar callings that relate to the jury and, not coincidentally, help gently pull medical professionals off their pedestals.]
Q And they still have to be careful and be safe. True?
A Yes.
[The motto here might be: Regular words for regular people! Think how much less effective this would have been had Kinnard not used “careful” and “safe” and instead talked about “following professional standards of care.”]
Q So, in your profession, you have to be careful on a holiday just as any other day. Is that fair?
A Yes, sir.
[A more cautious, and less effective, cross-examiner would have stopped right here. After all, he has made the point, sort of, at least enough to get by on a “save it for closing” theory of trial practice. But the next question drives home the point and fully punctures the “Easter” defense.]
Q So, the standard of care in this case on April 16 was the same as it would have been on Monday or Wednesday. Do you agree?
A Yes, sir.
[Although set up on the fly, this piece of cross was structured as a logical syllogism that marched from general to specific:
• Lots of professions/occupations have to work on holidays;
• Everyone who works on a holiday has to be as careful and safe as on any other day.
• Medicine is one of those professions.
• The medical standard of care is the same on a holiday as on any other day.]

Q Okay. I want to talk with you about one thing really. And that’s this April 16, Sunday, the time when Dr. White is called up to the ICU. This is what I really want to focus with you on. Okay?
[The cross-examiner is posting signs to guide the jury in following the path he is leading them down.]
A Yes, sir.
Q You agree that this is a team effort, don’t you?
A Yes, sir.
Q Looking after this patient on that Sunday. You had Dr. Reimers there. You had a nurse in the ICU. And you had Dr. White who was part of the team. Correct?
A Yes.
[The “team effort” questions set up what follows about the failure of communication among team members. It might have made for an even better prelude with one more question: “Part of what marks a good medical team is communicating clearly with each other, true?”]
Q And I need to look just a second at some of the things that haven’t been discussed at all yet in this record or that there has been very little discussion about it. This is at Page 111, Doctor. You ought to be able to see this okay. At 8:30 she gets a narcotic. Right? Up here.
A Yes, sir.
Q All right. So, she’s getting narcotics. And at 8:30 she’s sleeping. See that?
A Yes.
Q So, 9:30 she’s sleeping, isn’t she?
A Yes, sir.
Q I highlighted that in pink, I guess, there. Then at 10:00 she’s up in the chair without difficulty. Right?
A Yes, sir.
Q Then at 10:30, Dr. White comes by. And there has been testimony that everything was looking good at that time. Are you with me?
A Yes, sir.
Q Okay. Then at 10:45 she has some pain in the right leg and they give her a narcotic again. Right?
A Well—
Q Excuse me. That’s the anti-inflammatory?
A Yes, sir.
Q Okay. Excuse me. Now, at 11:00, she, obviously, is sitting up in order to have her hair washed. Right?
A Yes.
Q And a nurse is taking her head and washing her hair. Right?
A Yes, sir.
Q Of course. And we all know that the spinal cord runs from the base of the brain down, all of the way down as far as it goes in the back. Right?
A Yes, sir.
Q All right. And, now, Bette Donathan screams. Right?
A Yes, sir. That’s what’s written.
Q And you can imagine the shock on the nurse when this happens, the perfectly normal patient recovering nicely after surgery and, now, she’s washing her hair and she screams. Highly unusual, isn’t it?
A Yes. Not a common thing.
[Note how the questions stick closely to the facts except for narrow common-sense opinions: “highly unusual?”]
Q And she complains of—I’ve taken a list. I have a list here, Doctor. I’ve taken it from these records because this gets kind of confusing when you look at it, but this is all from the record. Screaming in pain. She’s talking about left hip and her back and leg cramps. She’s letting the nurse know. The nurse is asking her, obviously, we’ve recreated this. We’ll try to recreate this. She screams in pain. The nurse had to say to her what’s wrong. She said, my left hip and back is hurting, and I have leg cramps. And she tells the nurse I can’t get any relief. She’s put back in the bed. She’s repositioned in the bed and she’s turning and she can’t get relief. She says more to the nurse, I have cramps in my legs and now it’s in my upper back. And then this record shows she now has numbness in my legs. These are all things that you told Mr. Geracioti are consistent with a spinal hematoma. Correct?
[An important question that links the patient’s suffering to the liability issue. Note how the question can extend far longer than the usual cross question because it’s all based on established records admitted into evidence.]
A Could you scan that down so I can see the top of your list?
Q Scream in pain. Left hip. Back. Leg cramps. Can’t get relief. Cramps in leg.
A All of those could be symptoms of a spinal hematoma, yes.
Q Okay. Now, these are in the nurses’ notes. And before Dr. White comes up, do you remember from the facts that Dr. Reimers made a note. Do you remember that?
A I know that Dr. Reimers made a note. I don’t know exactly when that note was written relative to Dr. White being there.
Q I understand. We’re just talking about she obviously observed things and talked to the patient. True?
A Yes, sir.
Q Regardless of when Dr. White saw this note, Dr. Reimers makes these observations. And we see an entry here at 11:30. Do you see that, Doctor?
A Yes, sir.
Q Now, let’s focus more on what this page has. It’s telling Dr. Reimers. Dr. Reimers obviously asked her, hey, how are you. Excruciating cramps in hips, left greater than right. Correct?
A Yes, sir. That’s what the note says.
Q It’s in my bones. Right?
A That’s what it says, yes, sir.
Q That’s deep, isn’t it?
A Yes.
Q This is a serious problem, isn’t it?
A Well, I don’t think we know that yet. I mean, those are certainly serious complaints. We don’t know what the problem is yet.
[When the cross-examiner encounters minor quibbling with his question, he adjusts the next question accordingly by echoing what the witness has just said.]
Q We don’t know what the problem is, but the patient is telling these people things that are serious. Right?
A Well, again, we don’t know if they’re serious or not. The patient’s complaints sometimes lead to not serious findings. Those are complaints that she was hurting significantly. I agree with that.
Q It does say moaning. This patient is moaning, crying and diaphoretic. It means she’s sweating she’s in so much pain. This is not good. Fair?
[The question translates medical jargon into English and then immediately asks for a common-sense opinion: “Not good, fair?”]
A Again, those are very significant complaints, yes.
Q This is another note by Dr. Reimers. Now complaining of numbness in what, Doctor?
A Left lower extremity.
Q Unable to raise leg. Do you see that?
A Yes.
Q Now, looking at Dr. Reimers’s note, I think that you’ll agree that what happened was that the patient was sitting up having her hair washed, she screamed out, and the record shows she’s back repositioned in the bed and she’s tossing in the bed. Dr. Reimers comes along. And Dr. Reimers talks to the patient, also. And she does an exam likely while the patient is lying flat on her back in the bed. Correct?
[The patient lying flat on her back in the bed is one of those vivid details that conjures up a mental impression and helps the jury remember this line of questions.]
A I mean, I assume it would be, yeah. I mean, I can’t say that for sure, but that’s most typical.
Q Well, let’s look at her note. You see she’s got some notes there about testing pulses somewhere on there. There it is. Right there. See that? Now, that is totally possible and probable that the patient is now lying on her—in fact, right now is the time I need to go over there, Your Honor, if I could. (Brief pause.) Now, she’s probably on her back. And the doctor can feel the pulses in her ankles you know if you came in the room, I’m flat on my back, you could feel my pulses in my ankles. Right?
A Yes, sir.
Q If you’re thinking maybe I’ve got a vascular problem or something, see how my pulses are doing. True?
A Yes, sir.
Q So, Dr. Reimers could stand here and feel this and feel for spasm and not feel anything. True?
A She could feel for spasms and not feel spasms. Is that the question?
Q Right. She says no spasm palpable.
A Sure. She could feel somewhere and not feel spasms. Yes. Yes.
Q Well, the point is, Doctor, she’s on her back. Right?
A Yes.
Q Okay.
A Well, I mean, again, the way you’ve presented it, I assume that. And it’s more than likely correct, but I don’t know that for sure.
Q Well, I don’t know either, Doctor, but I’m just thinking of probabilities here. Okay. Now, we continue our list of Dr. Reimers’s entry, moaning, crying, sweating. And Bette Donathan tells Dr. Reimers I have numbness in my left lower leg and I can’t raise my left leg. If she’s on her back and she can’t raise her left leg, that could be due to pain. Correct?
A Yes, sir.
Q It could have hurt her so much. In fact, Dr. Reimers could have said, raise your left leg for me. She said, I can’t, it’s killing me. That could have happened?
[Again, the vivid details put the jury into the patient’s room. Note how a cross-examiner has the freedom to suggest inferences from the facts with an adverse witness that the examiner could never do with his own witness.]
A Yes, sir.
Q All of this happened, as you understand it, Bette Donathan told all of these people all of these things. Right?
A That’s what’s recorded, yes. So, yes, I think so.
[The lawyer has been building a box around the witness to create an impossible choice for the witness. Now he closes in. The questioner puts the defendant Dr. White into the liability spotlight, for missing all these significant symptoms.]
Q Before Dr. White gets there. Right?
A Yes, sir. I would say at least part of them were before Dr. White got there, yes.
Q Well, do you think part of it was while Dr. White was there?
A Or some of it could have been shortly after. I think Dr. Reimers and Dr. White were there at about the same time at this time frame, so when each part of that was said would be hard to know, but.
Q As the jury well knows by now, I cannot draw, Doctor. But we have a Nurse Hazard in the intensive care unit. Right?
A Yes, sir.
Q We have Dr. Reimers at the bedside of the patient. True?
A Yes. At some point she was there, yes.
Q And Dr. White comes up stat to the ICU. True?
A Yes.
Q You have two people, Dr. Reimers and Nurse Hazard, that Bette Donathan has given a world of information to about the problems that have happened to her. Correct?
A Yes.
[See how the examiner has set up a box around the witness – bringing out in detail all the key facts – the “world of information” – that two other members of the medical team recorded in the medical chart. Then the next question ropes in the doctor whom this witness is trying to defend, and it poses a terrible choice for the witness.]
Q Are you telling me, Doctor, that somehow these two team members right here did not tell Dr. White any of the things that Bette Donathan had complained about? Are you telling us that?
[Note the choice offered: the defense expert can dump on the two team members whom he is not defending, by answering “yes, they failed to communicate with my doctor,” which already seems dubious based on the vivid setup of all the dramatic details recorded in their notes. Or, the expert can implicate his own doctor by admitting that she must have known key facts reflected in the other providers’ notes but not her own. Or, the witness can try to duck the question. You don’t have to be a psychoanalyst to figure out what the witness is about to do: he ducks.]
A Well, I think you’re asking me to sort of speculate on what was said. All I’ve commented on is what Dr. White wrote in her progress note. I can’t make any comment on what anybody else said. She did not include that in that note if it was told to her.
[The witness has tried to derail the line of questions by saying he doesn’t really know what was or wasn’t communicated among the medical team members. This gives the cross-examiner a good reason to turn to the inarguable rule: the medical team is required to protect the patient, and that requires effective communication.]
Q Well, how—this team is supposed to be protecting this patient. Right?
A That would be the goal, yes.
Q How could a team of three people, two with very important information, how could a team member not know all of this?
[This is the very question an attentive juror would ask at this point. It’s posed in a non-leading way, which lends the question more power. Again, it puts the defendant the expert is trying to help in a harsh light.]
A Well, Dr. White came out of surgery, came up, took a history, documented what she took, whether she specifically spoke to the nurse, whether she spoke to Dr. Reimers, I’m not sure. That may be in there somewhere, but I’m not sure I have that in my memory whether she specifically documented that she spoke to them about these complaints. She documented what she did, that didn’t include any of those. I have to believe that she did not know about those at the time that she made that documentation.
Q Somebody should have gotten that information to Dr. White. Do you agree?
A Well, either to Dr. White or, I mean, Dr. Reimers had full ability to recognize and move on it if she knew these things as well.
[The witness plays dodgeball again. He gives a non-responsive answer that tries to shift the spotlight to another doctor, away from the defendant the witness is supporting. The cross-examiner has three choices here: 1. Scold the witness for not answering the question and try it again; 2. Take the witness’s bait and diverge into a discussion of the other doctor; 3. Try a different question that keeps the spotlight where the cross-examiner wants it. Either the first or third would be good tactical options for keeping control. Kinnard goes with No. 3. See how he gently deflects the bait offered by the witness, agreeing with the witness and promising to return later to that topic.]
Q Yes, she did. We’ll come back to that in a minute. I made a note, Doctor. Mr. Geracioti asked you about what did the standard of care require of Dr. White when she came up. And the standard of care required her to get a history, didn’t it?
A Yes.
Q What’s been going on. Correct?
A Yes, sir.
MR. KINNARD: Your Honor, may I pass this Webster dictionary up?
THE COURT: Give to it Ms. Scott and she’ll give it to him.
Q Okay. Would you look up the word history for us, please?
A Yes, sir.
Q Would you read what Webster says history is?
A An account of the past.
Q And that’s what a history is that you doctors get. You want—not only do you want how are you feeling, but what has led up to this. Correct?
A Yes.
[It might not have been strictly necessary to hand up the dictionary to the witness for a fairly ordinary meaning of a word. But never underestimate the power of a plain English word definition, which links the jury to the unfolding testimony. The dictionary also works here because its presentation slows the pace and highlights the importance of what is to follow.]
Q And the standard of care is to ask not only how are you, but what has led up to this. Correct?
A I think everybody would ask it in different ways, but, yes, you want to know how they are now and what is, what’s been going on to lead to the pain or place that you are now. Yes.
Q You’d want to know as a careful surgeon what has happened since I was last here to you, Bette Donathan. You’d want to know that, wouldn’t you?
[Note how this question simply restates what the witness has just said, to reinforce and underline its importance for the jury.]
A Yes.
Q Well, what did Dr. White say she asked Bette Donathan?
A I’m not sure that that was recorded, exactly what she asked. I mean, I remember well the note that Dr. White wrote, I believe, but what she asked, I’m not sure that I know where that would come from in the record.
Q Did you read Dr. White’s deposition to form your opinions in this case?
A I did.
Q You relied upon it?
A I did.
[The skilled cross-examiner has just laid the technical foundation under the Rules of Evidence to show the witness a piece of someone else’s testimony that otherwise might not be admissible at this point. The nearly universal rule, as set out in Fed. R. Evid. 705, is that out-of-court statements relied on by an expert are fair game for cross-examining the expert. Many trial lawyers forget the power of this rule, which lets the cross-examiner pile up a cafeteria tray full of tasty morsels of testimony from other witnesses’ depositions (plus other facts the expert looked at) and put them in front of the witness and jury, as soon as the cross-examiner has established that the source of the quotation was something the expert relied on in forming the expert’s opinions. Best of all, since these are other people’s words being quoted, there is no risk of the witness saying, “You are not understanding what I was saying in that passage.”]
Q Well, to refresh your memory, Page 56, Line 24. The question to Dr. White was. And did you determine that she even complained of that before you were trying to get an MRI done? And her answer was, I can’t remember if she, if she had. I hadn’t been told about it and she didn’t tell me because when I sat down and I talked to her and I looked her in the eyes, and I said, describe your pain to me. Tell me exactly what you are feeling. Do you see that, Doctor?
A Yes, sir.
Q I don’t see anywhere in here that Dr. White said tell me everything that’s happened to Bette since I was last here, what’s been going on. Do you see that there?
A That’s not there, no.
[The deposition transcript wasn’t as clean as it might have been, since the deposition questioner didn’t ask, “Tell me everything you did to obtain the history that you wrote in your note.” But most depositions are messy, and the cross-examiner is well advised not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. In other words, don’t forgo using a good impeachment quotation from a deposition just because the quotation isn’t a model of clarity – especially if you can use the quotation with a different witness, so there is no risk of the witness saying “That’s not what I meant.”
Here, the deponent’s words – “I said, describe your pain to me. Tell me exactly what you are feeling” – seem to suggest the doctor only asked for the patient’s present sensations, not what had come before. Of course, if there was another spot in the deposition where the doctor said she did ask the patient to recount everything that had happened since the doctor had last seen the patient, then that would make for excellent redirect examination, and would be a good reason not to use this particular piece of the defendant’s deposition on cross of an expert. Since I know Randy Kinnard is cagy enough not to create openings like this for his opponents, it’s safe to assume the quotation he did use was as close as the defendant came to describing in her deposition how she took the patient’s history.]
Q It should have been there, shouldn’t it?
A Well, I think we can all argue about the way we ask patient’s questions, but if you, if you go to a patient within a few minutes of these other events happening and you tell me what’s happening to you now, I think that I would certainly believe that the patient is going to recount the last few minutes and not just those instantaneous few seconds that I’m sitting there.
[The witness has an excuse for his doctor’s not asking the right question: essentially, he says: “doesn’t matter because the patient would give you the information whether or not you ask the right question.” Kinnard’s response shows he has anticipated the answer and is ready to show why it’s wrong. If Kinnard had been doing a more traditional, uptight cross, he might have groused, “Well, doctor, I asked you a yes/no question. ‘It should have been there, shouldn’t it!’ What’s your answer, yes or no!” This is a good example of why traditional cross-examination techniques often don’t work, because they nudge the lawyer to descend into nitpicking argument over whether or not the witness has answered the question. When you look at the question and answer above, the answer is responsive, even if it strays beyond the simple yes/no the question asked for. True, it might have been more obviously responsive if the witness had started the answer with, “Not necessarily, no. I think we can all argue …” So Kinnard, having listened carefully to the answer, is ready to meet the witness on the merits of what the witness has said.]
Q Well, you know, before Dr. White came along, they gave her, not only had she been getting narcotics that morning, they gave her morphine. Do you remember that?
A Yes, sir. I believe so.
Q And Nurse Hazard has testified that this entry right here means that the patient stopped breathing. She passed out. And Nurse Hazard was so worried she called for the people that help patients with breathing problems, that department known as respiratory therapy. And they come running up there. And Nurse Hazard said she was out. She had stopped breathing. And then she said I rubbed on her chest. I yelled at her to try to get her to come to. And Nurse Hazard was very, very worried. Okay. Assume all of that is true. Now, Dr. White—there is an entry at 11:52. And at 11:54, patient more alert. Do you see that?
A Yes, sir.
Q That means that Nurse Hazard was worried this patient, I could lose this patient, she’s not breathing, she’s out, and, now, thank God, she’s more alert. Okay. Assume those facts are true.
A Yes, sir.
[Foundation laid. Trap is sprung:]
Q Who is a better historian about what’s been going on, a woman who’s coming out of this phase she’s in and this state, having had narcotics, passed out, stopped breathing, Bette Donathan, or Dr. Reimers and Nurse Hazard?
A Well, if I assume everything that you’ve said, I might say Nurse Hazard would have been.
[Kinnard doesn’t let the witness get away with blaming the patient for the failure of the doctor to get the full history.]
Q And Dr. Reimers?
A I’m not as sure if Dr. Reimers was there early enough to have been a better historian, maybe so. But it seems to me that Dr. Reimers got there after the patient had already been sedated. Is that not true? If what everything that you say is true.
Q She had had some narcotics. She got there. And the record will show when Dr. Reimers was there. And my last question to you, Doctor, is you gave a statement in this case that you signed about your opinions in this matter. Remember?
[The cross-examiner has veered off a bit abruptly from his last, powerful line of questions. He might have ended even stronger if he had asked a few more questions tying together what he has just established: (1) two medical providers got the important clues about what was going on with the patient, (2) the other doctor whom this witness was trying to protect didn’t get the vital information, (3) it wasn’t the patient’s fault for the doctor missing the information; (4) if these three providers had just talked to each other, they could have figured it out. All of that has come out, though, albeit a bit fragmented, so this is probably a mere quibble by me.]
A Yes, sir.
Q Okay. And is it your opinion that an epidural catheter placed for post-op pain control should not have been used in Mrs. Donathan’s case?
A That’s my opinion, yes.
MR. KINNARD: That’s all, Your Honor.
[The cross-examiner finishes the cross with a quick in-and-out detour to another key issue in the case, whether the epidural should have been used at all. This witness was not on board with the rest of the defense team on this point. Under the “start strong, end strong” advice for a good cross-examination, this nugget was nicely placed at the end of the cross.]
Q. (BY MR. LEES) Good afternoon. My name is Jim Lees, and I represent Colton Fluke. You and I have never met before today; is that correct?
A. I believe that’s correct.
Q. When you took the witness stand, by the way, you were referred to as “Dr.”, is that the way you prefer to be addressed, Dr. Ziegler?
A. Not — Well, no, sir, I’m not — I’m not a doctor.
[One hears the hiss as the expert’s balloon of credentials begins to shrink.]
Q. Okay. You, in fact, have a Bachelor’s Degree?
A. That’s correct, yes, sir.
Q. And you have a law degree?
A. Correct.
Q. And you attended the University of Pittsburgh Law School for two years, correct?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. And then you left there, correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Because…?
[This was a non-leading question with little risk of a bad answer, since it focused on a narrow piece of the expert’s educational story.]
A. I went back to work for Marathon Oil Company, and I finished my Law Degree at South Texas College of Law, and I — I transferred my credits from Pitt.
Q. And just to follow through very briefly on your CV, your educational experience, Texas publishes, through the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, publications identifying those institutions whose degrees are illegal to use in Texas, correct?
A. Yes, sir.
[Note how the examiner jumps into the topic with a single well-honed question that attracts the jurors’ attention with “illegal” and tells them to stay tuned for some fireworks. This is a dramatic and a bit edgy way to delve into the topic of credentials from a non-accredited school. I don’t know Texas law, but I have a strong suspicion there is no legal penalty for truthfully saying that one has a degree from a school not recognized by the state of Texas. Still, the witness agreed with the “illegal” characterization, so all is well.]
Q. One of the institutions that Texas says is illegal to use a degree from is Kennedy Western University, correct?
A. At this time, that’s correct.
Q. Okay. And you list Kennedy Western University on your CV as a place where you got your M.S. Safety Engineering Courses.
A. Like — Courses, yes, sir, courses.
Q. Didn’t you used to list a degree from there?
A. Yes, sir, because after I received a degree for several years it was not on the list you refer to.
Q. Says here you attended Kennedy Western University from 1994 to 2003?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. So you went to that college for nine years?
A. No, sir. I — I took my courses –huh– by correspondence all in one year, and then I finished my thesis, which was on the Brenham salt dome –huh– explosion, in 2003.
Q. And you were living in Texas at that time?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. And where is Kennedy Western University located?
A. Huh– It was a — At that time it was a program that was in –huh– Thousand Oaks, California, and all of the faculty members that I worked with for my correspondence courses were at the University of California, at Santa Barbara.
Q. Just so I’m clear, then, did you go to Santa Barbara, to the university, and attend there?
A. No, sir, it was a correspondence course.
Q. Correspondence course.
A. I — I was sent there by the U.S. Department of Energy.
[The witness’s explanation doesn’t matter, because the message is clear: his master’s degree in the topic for which he is testifying in court came from a correspondence school not recognized by Texas education authorities.]
Q. You –huh– You, in your past, have branched out in terms of the things you are willing to offer opinions on, is that fair?
A. I — I don’t know what you mean by “branched out”, I’ve worked on a lot of safety areas –huh– OSHA, a lot of different things.
Q. Well, has a court ever said you weren’t qualified to give an opinion in a court of law in Texas on something you were trying to give an opinion on?
A. No, I re — I recall one –huh– case that I gave a deposition in, I was working as an expert, I sat in that case, I did not have enough information, by the time the trial came along I was not working on the case –huh– been several years, as I recall, the attorney tried to use my deposition that I’d said I didn’t have enough information for, and the judge did not let that be read into evidence, so that’s the only case I recall.
[The witness has just changed his answer from “no” to “yes, once”. Rather than quibbling with that change, or chasing the witness’s explanation, the cross-examiner starts to unspool his source information. This might be hearsay but because it is intended to impeach a witness’s credibility, the recitation of what the other court said is not objectionable.]
Q. Well, I may be misinformed, then. I’m looking at an Appellate Opinion from the Fourteenth Court of Appeals, on a case called Memorial Hermann Hospital System –huh– from Harris County, Texas, in which there is reference to an expert witness that has your name, were you involved in that case?
A. Yes, sir, that’s the case I just referred to.
Q. Says here you were attempting to give an opinion — and I’m reading now from the Appellate Court of Texas —
A. Yeah.
Q. — as evidenced by his deposition testimony and accompanying exhibits, Ziegler concluded that Memorial Hermann Hospital System failed to properly select the patient food carts in accordance with the safety concerns for the employees who operate them. You gave a deposition on food carts?
A. Yes, sir, it was on — on training and the selection of the food cart —
Q. Attempting to help the lawyers who were suing that hospital, correct?
A. It was an OSHA issue, yes, sir.
Q. It was an OSHA issue?
A. Yeah.
Q. According to the appellate court, you had never even seen the food carts, correct?
A. Yeah, I seen — I’d seen pictures and the invoices and I went to the manufacturer and saw them.
Q. You didn’t even know, according to the appellate court, how big the carts were, correct?
A. I — I doubt that because — Well, I don’t know what they said, but I — I saw the exemplar carts.
Q. Well, I don’t want you to — to think I’m trying to trick you here, I’ll just read from the appellate opinion. Yet he had not seen the carts in person, he did not know how big the carts were, how much the carts weighed, or how much they could or should carry. He also had no knowledge of the relevant factors in determining whether the weight of a loaded cart or amount of force to be applied to it would be excessive. Yet Ziegler concluded that the hospital failed to properly train its employees in how to operate a food cart. You gave a deposition on that subject?
A. Yes, sir. An OSHA issue.
Q. And the court said no way.
A. Well, for a reason, because the –huh– when I gave my deposition I said I didn’t have that information, but I did give an opinion they didn’t have a training program because they didn’t.
[Translating the court’s holding into a crisp “the court said no way” works well to box in the witness. The witness retreats to his defense that the lawyer in the other case had failed to give him certain information. The cross-examiner could have insisted on a simple yes or no answer, but it wasn’t necessary, since the answer was patently defensive.]

Q. You go around a lot and criticize hospitals and companies that they don’t have training programs?
A. I criticize a lot of people for not having training programs, just like this case, yes, sir.

[Note how the witness has tried to lure the cross-examiner back into discussing the core of his opinions in this case, which the lawyer resists. Instead, the cross-examiner moves into the list of corporations obtained from his online research.]

Q. I’m sure you do. Let me ask you just a few questions about some of the businesses you’ve been in, and again, I may have this wrong, but I just got this off the Secretary of State’s website, says you are or were the registered agent for Rini, R-I-N-I, Design, Incorporated, is that a company you have been or are affiliated with?
A. Huh– I probably incorporated that for her or was — was a registered agent, that’s — that’s my wife and that’s her –huh– comput — her –huh– graphic design company.
Q. Okay. So that’s your wife’s company.
A. Right.
Q. Let me go to the next one. Edward Ziegler Racing, Inc., is that anything to do with you?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. What’s that company?
A. Huh– I have a company that –huh– we — we both sponsor and have race cars — vintage — vintage race cars.
Q. I see. Is that company still in existence?
A. Yes.
Q. Because it says here in the Secretary of State “forfeited existence” —
A. Okay.
Q. — okay? Do you know why the existence was forfeited?
A. Probably because we didn’t keep it as a — as a corporation and file the paperwork, we didn’t — didn’t need that anymore, we still have the company, but it’s a sole proprietorship.
Q. Didn’t file the paperwork, franchise taxes, things like that, right?
A. No, sir.
Q. No?
A. Filed — We — I mean, if — if you don’t want to keep a corporation you just simply don’t file the paperwork.
Q. So you didn’t want to keep that company?
A. As a corporation, that’s correct.
Q. Do you still have a racing company?
A. Yes, as a sole proprietorship.
Q. And you race what, cars?
A. Vintage race cars, yes.
Q. Vintage race cars. Erebus, E-R-E-B-U-S, Energy, Inc., you’re listed as a registered agent for that company.
A. Yes.
Q. What’s that company about?
A. Huh– Doesn’t exist anymore, but it was an oil and gas company.
Q. Did you start it?
A. We –huh– It was set up but I don’t think we ever did any business with it.
Q. Who set it up, when you say “we”?
A. My wife and I.
Q. Wife and I. And when did you start that oil company?
A. I don’t recall, probably in the 1980’s.
Q. That one says “forfeited existence”, correct?
A. I don’t –.
Q. Did you decide not to pursue that company?
A. Yeah — Yes, that’s correct.
Q. Experts United, Incorporated, is that a company you’re affiliated with?
A. Not — Not sure anymore.
Q. You’re not sure if you have a company called Experts United, Incorporated or not?
A. Not — At this time I’m not sure. It was a company we set up.
Q. Well —
A. That — That was the company that did the business with — ultimately with –huh– Halliburton KBR Government Services and we — we operated as Safety United, Incorporated.
Q. You got part of that government money for Halliburton to go do some safety consulting for safety in Iraq, didn’t you?
A. Right, to supply equipment to our troops.
Q. And so Experts United, Incorporated is owned by whom?
A. Probably by my wife and I.
Q. Your wife and you. Is that still in existence or not?
A. I don’t know.
Q. You don’t know?
A. I don’t know.
Q. I’ll just tell you the Secretary of State says it by the way, okay?
[The witness has now disowned an interest in four companies in a row that he had originally owned. His lack of knowledge about whether his company still exists paints a picture of someone spread so thin he doesn’t know where he is.]
A. Okay.
Q. Okay. Dynamic Marine Engineering, Inc., is that a company you’re affiliated with?
A. Used to be.
Q. Used to be?
A. Yeah.
Q. What was the purpose of that company?
A. That was my –huh– I — I owned a welding and maintenance company in Cameron, Louisiana that did a lot of –huh– work in — in chemical plants in the offshore oil industry for several years back in the 1980’s.
Q. Who owned that company?
A. Huh– I did.
Q. You did. That company still in business?
A. No.
Q. No. What happened to it?
A. Huh– When I sold my welding company, about 1989 or ’90, I stopped using that business.
Q. You had a welding company, too?
A. Yes, sir. I’m a member of the ANSI Welding and Cutting Safety Committee, I’ve been in the welding business for years.
Q. So you’re also an expert not only in food carts and oil and gas but welding?
[In a single sentence, the cross-examiner hopscotches the witness around his diverse fields of claimed expertise, highlighting their dubious nature.]

A. Well, the food — yeah, the food cart is OSHA, but, yes, I’m — I’m — I’m an expert in welding, yes.
Q. Okay. And I’m sorry, is that company still in existence or not, Dynamic Marine Engineering, Inc.?
A. Well, I haven’t used it for twenty years but it could still be in existence, I don’t know.
Q. Well, according to the Secretary of State, it says “forfeited existence” —
A. Okay. Probably —
Q. — so —
A. Probably so.
Q. Probably so.
A. Yeah.
Q. How about Rini Florist One, Incorporated, is that a company you’re affiliated with?
A. It was a flower shop my wife had for about five years.
Q. You — It lists you as the registered agent, right?
A. Okay.
Q. Is that one still in business?
A. No.
Q. Ziegler Investment Management, Inc., is that one of your companies?
A. I don’t recognize that one.
Q. Says Edward R. Ziegler, list an address on Westheimer in Houston, is that your business address?
A. That’s correct.
Q. And you don’t recognize Ziegler Investment Management, Inc.?
A. No, sir.

[No wonder the cross-examiner stays on this path. The witness keeps giving answers that don’t help his credibility, as he fails to recognize even the names of some of his own companies.]

Q. Hmm. How about Ziegler slash (Sic) Peru, Inc., does that one ring a bell?
A. Yes, sir, that’s my current oil company, we drilled about a hundred wells in the last year.
Q. Who owns your oil company?
A. My wife and I.
Q. And how long’s the oil company been in business?
A. Since about 1993 roughly.
Q. Here’s one City Best Magazine Publishers, Inc., you’re listed as registered agent, any affiliation with that company?
A. My wife set up that company to –huh– buy a magazine, yes.
Q. All right. Is that one still in existence?
A. I don’t think so.
Q. Ziegler Operating Company, does that one ring a bell?
A. Yes.
Q. Is that one still in existence?
A. Yes.
Q. What’s that one do?
A. That was my original consulting and oil company I started in 1981.
Q. Your original consulting and what?
A. Oil company.
Q. So why did you start all of these other ones?
[Because the subject matter is completely safe for the cross-examiner, a “why” question works well to hand the witness a shovel and let him dig his own hole.]

A. Huh– Dif — Just different purposes at different times.
Q. You kept incorporating different business after different business after different business as I’m looking through the years of your professional life, fair enough?
A. Yes, sir. In thirty years I’ve had about ten different businesses, that’s correct.
Q. Well –huh– Do you have a landscape company, by the way?
A. No.
Q. Huh– First Safety Consultants United, Inc., is that one of your companies?
A. Yes, that might be the one that Safety United was operated through.
Q. Pardon me?
A. That may be the one that Safety United was operated through.
Q. What’s Safety United, is that another company?
A. Well, it’s the one I mentioned earlier when you asked me about Halliburton KBR, that’s our — that was our primary safety consulting business.
Q. I thought the Ziegler Operating Company was?
A. No.
[The purpose of the expert’s various companies is now thoroughly confused, further undermining his credibility.]

Q. No. Okay. In addition to operating all of these companies at various times — and I know some of them are out of existence, you testify as expert witness a lot?
A. Not much anymore.
Q. Okay. Because you’re kind of busy with this other stuff?
A. Yeah, I drilled a hundred wells — we have — we have four drilling rigs and I’ve drilled a hundred wells in the last year.
Q. Well, you’ve testified against a hospital, right?
A. Yes.
Q. Who else have you given opinions against in a court of law or attempted to besides a hospital or in this case you’re talking about Swan, you’re talking about Mr. Graves and EOG, what other kinds of businesses have you given opinions about?
A. Well, in — in the last –huh– thirty years roughly a lot of businesses I’ve given opinions about, both positively and against –huh– dealing with almost every aspect of safety. When you go through the OSHA Training Institute for construction and general industry, that covers everything that’s in OSHA, virtually every type of workplace, and as a certified safety professional, we deal with all industries.
Q. So you are the guy when it comes to safety in the — the workplace, right?
A. I am one of the guys, yes. I — I –

[The cross-examiner has now set up the witness to be someone of self-proclaimed vast and diverse expertise, who should know why the hose assembly failed. So he asks the $64,000 question.]

Q. I want you to tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury why the hose assembly came apart.
A. Well, I — I didn’t look at that, that wasn’t my area. I know why Mr. — I know why Mr. Fluke was killed but I don’t — I don’t know why the hose came apart, that wasn’t my area.

Q. Okay. Why was Mr. Fluke killed? I’ll bite.

[Under the normal “rules” of cross-examination, Lees has just violated two commandments: asking a “why” question and asking the witness to repeat unfavorable testimony. It works here because it’s a way of underscoring the cross-examiner’s basic point: that this is a witness of vast and diverse self-proclaimed expertise – expertise already shown to have a dubious if not bizarre career trajectory – and yet the witness cannot bring himself to look at the core issue of the case: why did the hose assembly fail.]
A. Mr. Fluke was killed because Mr. Graves, Mr. Wright left him and his truck in a bad position, let him pressure up. Mr. Fluke was not –huh– was not properly trained and did not have a proper safety program or the knowledge from his employer to –huh– be able to conduct the operation safely. Hoses come apart all the time, but if you’re at the right place and do it correctly, and position your truck the right place, then you don’t get killed or injured.
Q. And so you came all the way from Houston, Texas to tell these people under oath that’s why Tim Fluke was killed, correct?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. You can’t even answer my question as to why that hose came apart?
A. I wasn’t — I wasn’t –huh– designated to be the person to decide why the hose came apart.
Q. Here’s the fitting —
A. Yeah.
Q. — here’s the hose. All your expertise, you want to take a look at it and tell me why it came apart.
[The cross-examiner keeps pushing for an answer because the witness has shown he wants to avoid the question. The answer cannot help the expert’s side, and thus he evades. The more the cross-examiner gives the expert an open-ended opportunity to explain what happened to the hose assembly, the more evasive the witness appears.]
[Bench conference not transcribed.]
Q. (BY MR. LEES) Question stands. Based on your vast expertise, look at it, tell us why did it come apart?
A. Don’t — I don’t know why it came apart, it could have come apart because it was abused, it could have come apart because it was pulled on, I — I mean, a number of different reasons —
Q. Wow.
A. — but the — but the — but the bottom line is, if Mr. Fluke had not by his supervisor and his employer be allowed and required to be where he was, he would not have been killed or injured.
Q. You know, if he had called in sick that day, with all due respect, he’d be alive today, right?
[A neat way to ridicule the witness’s point.]
A. Well, maybe one of his co-workers would be dead but he might be alive, yes, sir.
Q. There’s a million reasons in hindsight, you can look back and say if, if, if, somebody would be alive today, but God doesn’t give us do-overs, Mr. Ziegler, does he?
A. No, sir, that’s why you have to do it right to start with, it’s not — it’s not if, if, if, it’s if you have the proper training and if you’re standing and required allowed to be at the right place, that’s why you don’t need a do-over if you do it safely.
[The logic of the witness’s position about safe practices should apply equally to the defendant, and makes for a good “turnabout is fair play” question. The cross-examiner knows this won’t bring a positive answer, but will further show the witness’s bias.]
Q. Right. And so if Makena and Bridgeport/Jacksboro had just done it safely, this young man would be alive today, wouldn’t he?
A. I don’t know what that means, because —
Q. I’m sure you don’t?
A. — a hose can come apart for any reason, that’s why you always stand the right place and do it safely as far as the procedures.
MR. LEES: Judge, I don’t have any further questions for this guy.
THE COURT: The Plaintiff may call the next witness.
MR. LEVENTHAL: At this time, we will call the defendant, Dr. Perez, on cross-examination, pursuant to the Rules of Civil Procedure.
THE COURT: Very well. Dr. Perez.
JESUS JAIME PEREZ, MD., having been first duly sworn to tell the truth, was examined and testified upon his oath as follows:
MR. LEVENTHAL: Your Honor, I would request that the Court instruct the jury on the difference between calling somebody on cross versus direct.

[This is an optional prelude that heightens the drama and highlights for the jury the examiner’s right to lead this witness on direct. A less experienced judge might have floundered. This one delivers a smooth and well-taken instruction that sets the table for any leading questioning that the examiner wants to do.]
THE COURT: The purpose of calling somebody on cross-examination, is largely to be allowed to question them using leading questions. As you will see, you’ve seen leading questions on cross-examination of other witnesses; but basically, the plaintiff has the right to do that. That does not make Dr. Perez the plaintiffs witness. It simply means, that the plaintiff is using this opportunity to question him in a certain way, that arguably the plaintiff feels is appropriate to present her case. The defendant, Dr. Perez, also has the right to be examined by his own attorney in the same fashion. You will see some of those same types of questions. Later on, Ms. Doig will be examining Dr. Perez on direct examination; which is the same way that the plaintiff has been presenting questions, which means questions that call for a story. You will see those different types of questioning here. You are to evaluate the testimony of. Dr. Perez like any other witnesses, regardless of who calls him.. Okay.

MR. LEVENTHAL: Thank you, Judge.
CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. LEVENTHAL:
Q. Good afternoon, sir.
A. Good afternoon.
Q. Could you tell the jury your name.
A. Jesus Jaime Perez.
Q. And you go by James Perez?
A. James, correct.
Q. You are a physician?

A. Yes.
Q. Your medical specialty is what?
A. Family medicine.
Q. You practice where?
A. Burlington, Colorado.
Q. Tell the jury a little bit about your educational training and background, please.
A. My training consists of going to high school there in Burlington, Colorado. Going to college in Fort Collins, CSU, to be specific. I majored in microbiology, graduated with honors. I was in the premed program, and ended up going to medical school at CU in Denver, where I did my four-year medical school training. Through my medical school training, primary care became a calling to me. I was interested in taking care of all aspects of patient care, from pediatrics to geriatrics. And so, through my internship and rotation at the hospital, I very quickly figured that that was really what I loved to do, and that was my calling. So, after finishing my four years at CU medical school, I was fortunate enough to get in through the Greeley Family Medicine Program. Greeley at that time was one of the top primary care medicine residency trainings for specific emphasis in rural medicine.
Q. Okay. You did – so, did you do a residency in family practice?
A. Yes.
Q. How long was your residency?
A. The residency is three years in length.
Q. SO, you completed three years of intense training in how to take care of patients that you could see in family practice?
A. Yes.

[So far, this has sounded much like a direct examination by the doctor’s own lawyer, or the kind of questions that might be asked at a “soft” deposition. But now watch as the cross-examiner moves from general training to specific training in the key subject of evaluating chest pain.]
Q. You heard some witnesses testify as medical students, third year, second year medical students, part of the training was evaluation of chest pain?
A. Yes.
Q. You had that same training; didn’t you?
A. Yes.
Q. And, in fact, you had the same training that Dr. Magorien said that he teaches, and Dr. Duran, and Dr. von Elten say they teach, and they took when they were studying to become family practice doctors?
A. That’s correct.

[Note how the cross-examiner frames what otherwise could be abstract “standard of care” into the concrete “how you were trained in medical school.” He also quickly links to the experts who have already testified for the plaintiff, who put the abstract standard into the concrete “what I teach.” Now the cross-examiner marches directly into the heart of the case, the failure of the defendant to consider the aorta as part of the chest pain evaluation.]
Q. That training included, that when you evaluate somebody for chest pain, you look at worst first; Page 8 right?
A. You look at life-threatening conditions, yes.

[“Worst first” is a pithy way to put the diagnostic priority rule. Any time the cross-examiner can frame a “rule” with two or three words, is good.]
Q. That when you’re evaluating somebody for chest pain, you have to consider the aorta?
A. Yes.
Q. That is part of your training; isn’t it?
A. Yes.

[Having set up and validated a simple rule, the cross-examiner sets up some additional training background that he will return to later.]
Q. You also work at the emergency room at Kit Carson Memorial Hospital; don’t you?
A. I rotate with three other physicians to cover the emergency room, yes.
Q. You have a contract with the hospital to do that?
A. It is part of my job description, yes.
Q. Tell the jury about your contract to provide emergency room service at Kit Carson Hospital, when you first entered into that contract, and what it requires?
A. The contract came about at the end of my third year. I basically agreed to become a hospital employee. And in the contract, there is a job description that talks about how many hours we anticipate to do in clinical care; that we will practice OB, that we will do surgical OB; that we will do certain procedures; and we will also rotate in a fair fashion with the other physicians there covering the emergency room, since there is no full-time emergency room staff.
Q. Okay. And so, in order to work in the emergency room, you were required to be ACLS certified; weren’t you?
A. That is correct.
Q. Can you tell the jury what ACLS stands for?
A. Advanced Cardiac Life Support.

Q. You have to actually study the test materials and then take a test?
A. Correct.
Q. You have to be recertified every how many years?
A. It is every two years.
Q. In addition to — and that is so that you can provide appropriate care for a patient that comes in with chest pain?

[Here is a minor quibble with an otherwise brilliant cross-examination. This section on ACLS certification could have been moved to a place just before the examiner starts quoting from the ACLS training book. That would have made the ACLS literature impeachment a bit stronger by making the nexus more obvious. Sometimes lawyers reflexively put all of their “training and qualifications” material into a preliminary section of the examination without tying it into specific substance of the case.]
A. That’s correct.
Q. Right. You also had – to become an emergency room doctor, you had to become a ATLS certified?
A. Correct.
Q. And what does “ATLS” stand for?
A. Advanced Trauma Life Support.
Q. And again, there are materials to study, and you studied those materials and took the test, and you are ATLS certified?
A. That’s correct.
Q. SO, the types of patients that you’ve seen in the emergency room in Burlington include — it is not unusual for you actually to see chest pain patients, is it?
A. I see chest pain patients on a regular, basis.
Q. It is one of the most common presentations, probably after headache, that people are seen for in the emergency room?
A. Yes, very close to low back pain, too.
Q. You’ve seen patients coming off the freeway who have been in accidents, trauma patients?
A. Unfortunately, yes.
Q. You see all patients that emergency room doctors see?

A. Yes.
Q. In fact, you believe that the standard of care for diagnosing a patient who presents in the emergency room for chest pain is the same, whether that doctor seeing him is a family practice doctor or an emergency room doctor?
A. In the initial evaluation of a patient through the emergency room, yes.

[The next question is a natural follow-through to the prior one, but one many lawyers don’t follow because of the bad indoctrination so many of us get to “not ask one question too many” and to “save the point for closing.” The next question is obviously important to validate the plaintiff’s expert having a similar, but not the same, specialty as the defendant. Technically it doesn’t have to be asked. The examiner has just established that the “standard of care” for family medicine doctors and emergency doctors in evaluating a chest pain patient in the ER is the same. So this next question is only necessary if the examiner wants the jury to understand the key points as they’re being made, which every trial lawyer who wants to conduct an effective cross-examination should want.]
Q. So, it was fair to have an emergency room doctor come and evaluate your care and testify in this case. That was fair to you; wasn’t it?
A. Yes.
Q. Just as it is fair to have a family practice doctor, or anybody who understands the principles of evaluating a patient with chest pain?
A. Yes.

[More questions that tie the witness’s training to his job duties to what happened to the patient in this case. You can see the relentless progression of logic.]
Q. Part of your job was to be able to recognize signs and symptoms of problems with the aorta, right?
A. That’s correct.
Q. That was part of your duty to Mr. Epperly and any other patient that comes in with chest pain?
A. Yes.

[The cross-examiner begins a series of questions that close another escape route. In “rules of road,” this is the “not important” escape for violating a rule. Here the lack of testing for what turned out to be wrong with the patient WAS important.]
Q. I want to begin with what is not contested in this case. You admit that Mr. Epperly died from an aortic dissection; don’t you?
A. That’s correct.
Q. You admit that when you saw Mr. Epperly on September 19, 2003, that he was, in fact, experiencing an aortic dissection?
A. In hindsight, with all of the information we have, with the autopsy report that we have in front of us; more than likely, yes.
Q. You admitted that you done a CT on the 19th, had you ordered a CT examination at the Kit Carson Hospital, more likely than not, Mr. Epperly’s aortic dissection actually would have been diagnosed?
A. Again, in hindsight, that is probably yes.

Q. In fact, you told us that was probable?
A. Probable, yes.

[Nothing wrong with having the witness repeat a favorable admission.]
Q. And had that been diagnosed on the 19th, that more likely than not, Mr. Epperly would have survived?
A. The probability would be in his favor, yes.
Q. You also admit that the signs and symptoms that Mr. Epperly presented with — the new onset or acute onset of chest pain that day, and the pain radiating from his chest to his back – that those signs and symptoms that he was telling you about were, in fact, from this aortic dissection that he was experiencing at that time?
A. With the information that we have now, in hindsight, yes.

[Note the cross-examiner’s self-discipline in not taking the witness’s bait about “hindsight.” It would have been easy to take a detour into what was knowable only by hindsight versus what could have been known with a better examination or testing at the time. But hindsight is where the witness wants to go, not the examiner, not yet, and so the attorney continues to set out the basic admissions that frame the case.]
Q. You also admit that had you ordered a CT on the 23d, when you saw him, that more likely than not, the aortic dissection that he had, which started on the 19th, would have been diagnosed?
A. More than likely, yes.
Q. And that more likely than not, had you made the diagnosis on the 23d, in the morning when you saw him, that he would have received appropriate care and would have survived?
A. The probability of survival would be, again, in his favor, yes.

[The whole case has now been mostly admitted. The only surviving defense is whether the diagnosis could and should have been made at the time, or only through “hindsight.”]

[Now watch a very adroit use of professional literature. Of course, Fed. R. Evid. 803(18) and its state rule analogs require that lawyers not start spouting quotations from books until they have been established by the witness or some other source as “reliable authority.” Too many lawyers go through the groundwork abruptly, asking only the “magic words” question without dwelling on what it means to be a “reliable authority.” Here, the witness’s use of the very book establishes its authority.]
Q. I, throughout this case, have used a textbook of medicine called Harrison’s Principles of Medicine. And I represented that this was a textbook you had on your desk in your office?
A. I have that in my office.
Q. Not always on your desk.
A. It fluctuates.
Q. This is a textbook that a reliable authority, in fact, it is one of the basic textbooks of medicine that almost everybody has who practices medicine, family medicine at least?
A. It was one of the primary books, yes.
Q. You had it in there, because you used it as a reference book?
A. I will rely on it at times, yes. I don’t do that on a daily basis; but yes, I have used it as a resource, if I need to use it.

Q. And you admit this is the textbook in effect at the time — and this is the 15th Edition, 2001. This was a 2003 case.

[Having locked in the reliability of the book with five questions where a less skilled advocate would have used one or two, the examiner now publishes the key quotation. This is usually best done by showing the quotation on a screen or poster board at the same time the examiner reads the text aloud. (Inviting the witness to read the text aloud is often a prelude to a garbled, unintelligible recitation.)]
A. That is correct.
Q. Would you tell the jury why a chest x-ray is insufficient, a chest x-ray is not sufficient to exclude the diagnosis of an aortic dissection?

[Asking a “why” question at this point posed a risk, but not a large one. The witness has just agreed that the authoritative textbook which he keeps in his office and uses from time to time taught that a chest x-ray is not enough to find an aortic dissection. The witness could now respond that he disagrees with the textbook, but instead gives a valuable admission that is all the more strong for being put in his words, not the lawyer’s.]
A. It doesn’t have the appropriate sensitivity, meaning, you could have a normal chest x-ray, and miss an aortic dissection.

[The examiner now brings the literature quotation down to this case.]
Q. You knew that when you saw Mr. Epperly and you ordered the chest x-ray, that that was not the test to run, if you were going to exclude or rule out aortic dissection; didn’t you?
A. If I was going to be looking for aortic dissection, I would have ordered a CAT Scan.
Q. Now, Mr. Epperly came into your office on the 19th, and he came into your office at the clinic, which is directly across the street from the hospital; isn’t it?
A. That’s correct.
Q. It is what, 50 feet from the hospital? 50 yards from the hospital?
A. The length of a street, plus maybe a quarter of a block.

[Does it matter exactly how far the doctor’s office is from the hospital, which is already established as “directly across the street”? No. The extra question is worth asking because it helps establish vivid detail about the proximity.]
Q. When he came in, he didn’t have an appointment?
A. No, he came in unassigned.
Q. This is the first time you ever saw Mr. Epperly; right?
A. That’s correct.
Q. And when he came in, he reported to your nurse that he had severe chest pain; right?
A. He reported that he had chest pain.
Q. Okay. That took him to the top of the list, even though you had other patients who had appointments. Other patients who had scheduled appointments, whether it was days or weeks in advance, Mr. Epperly became the priority; didn’t he?
A. Like many other patients before him and after him, that present to the clinic with a complaint of chest pain, yes, he took priority.

Q. And tell the jury why — let me ask you this. When Mr. Epperly presented with chest pain, did he have left arm pain?
A. That was not given in the history.
Q. Did he have a report of crushing chest pain? We have heard the classic signs of a heart attack are crushing chest pain, radiating to the left arm. Did he have crushing chest pain, radiating to the left arm?
A. He had chest pain, described as a pressure.
Q. Not this classic presentation, crushing chest pain radiating to the left arm?
A. Chest pain with pressure would be also presentation of a heart attack.
Q. Not classic presentation, but consistent with a heart attack?
A. It was consistent. And if you look at some books, it can be classic.

[It’s not clear why the examiner and the witness have digressed into what types of chest pain symptoms amount to “classic” descriptions of heart attack pain, since the patient didn’t have a heart attack. But now the examiner brings it back to something important: that a chest pain description of this type puts the patient at “the top of the list” to be seen by the doctor. This kind of detail is useful because every juror has had the experience of waiting forever in a doctor’s waiting room, so a condition that sends someone to the top of the heap is impressive.]
Q. So, then, because he complained of chest pain, he goes to the top of the list which means that he was seen before the other patients?
A. That’s correct.
Q. Is that because when somebody complains of chest pain, it is possible that they may have an immediately life-threatening condition?
A. They would be — potentially, yes, in serious danger or trouble.
Q. In serious danger or trouble of dying immediately?
A. Correct.
Q. Right?
A. Correct.
Q. Okay. And so, he goes to the top of the list. And when you saw him, you then asked him what his history was; right?
A. Yes.
Q. You learned that he had this sudden onset of pain while he was walking that day?

A. He said a new onset of chest pain, not sudden. That is very important to verify. You have been talking about the standard of care throughout your whole presentation here. And I believe that I provided the standard of care. And to me, there is a big difference between sudden onset and a new onset.
Q. Okay.
A. Because on an regular basis, we do get patients with new onset chest pain. When we cover the emergency room, that is one of the top reasons why we see somebody at 2:00 o’clock in the morning; they have a new onset of chest pain.
[The thus far compliant witness thus far now begins to defend himself, on the narrow difference between “new onset” and “sudden onset” of chest pain. A less skilled cross-examiner, hung up on receiving a discursive answer to a yes/no question, would have complained that the witness was saying too much, and would thereby lose control of the encounter and look weak. Instead, this cross-examiner calmly moves to take apart the new/sudden distinction.]
Q. Okay. Well, so, then are you saying that because this was new — let me ask you this: What is the difference, Mr. Epperly said he had experienced chest pain that morning, right?
A. Correct.
Q. What time did he experience the chest pain?
A. He said in the a.m. I did not get the exact time from him.
Q. Okay. Well — and was — when you say in the a.m., did it start at 6:00 a.m. and gradually build up, or did you ask him, was this sudden, or was this something that gradually came over several hours?
A. The question was: When did it start, and it was in the a.m.
Q. So, do you have an answer then as to whether this was sudden? Start, you know, ten minutes ago, and I’m here — started an hour ago, and I’m here. Do you have an answer about whether that was sudden, or did you just know it was new?
A. I knew it was a new onset.
Q. You can’t — you’re not telling the jury, because you didn’t ask the question about whether it was sudden, that you determined it was not sudden?
A. When the patient has a sudden onset, most of the time, like when he tells you other history, he will tell you it came on suddenly. In his case, he said that it was this — in the a.m., in the morning.
Q. Did you ask him?
A. I asked him when it started, and he said in the a.m.
Q. Did you ask him whether it was sudden?
A. I don’t recall.
[Without a good deposition that closed this escape path, the cross-examiner would have been on difficult ground if the witness had a new memory of in fact having posed the critical question to the patient. Now with the critical admission that the witness couldn’t recall having asked that question, the cross-examiner can underscore the point, which deflates the witness’s only attempt so far in the examination to defend himself. The next few questions lock in the admission.]
Q. So, as you sit here, you don’t know whether he had a sudden onset of chest pain?
A. I can’t recall. I am not going to make up a story on that I knew it was a new onset, started in the morning.
Q. Okay. So, Mr. Epperly comes in and tells you that he had a new onset of chest pain that started the very morning he came in to see you; right?
A. Yes.
Q. It may have been sudden, you don’t know?
A. Potentially.
Q. Okay. And he told you that it was a chest pain, and he told you that it was radiating to his back?
A. That’s correct.
Q. Not just to his – it was radiating to his mid-back, and to his low back?
A. When he came in, his presentation of the chest pain radiating to the back and low back pain, he had a history of low back pain. When he presented to the clinic on the 19th, his primary source of pain, or the one that he focused on the most, was actually his low back. That was one of the reasons he got the Torado1 injection, was for the back pain, which was more severe than the chest pain.
Q. But you wrote chest pain, radiating to the mid-back, and low back pain; right?
A. Chest pain, radiating to the back, and low back pain; yes.
Q. All right. At that point, even though he didn’t have left arm pain, and even though it was not what some folks describe as classic for a heart attack, you immediately hooked him up to an EKG?
A. That’s a standard of care.
Q. That is because, even though the presentation may not be classic, his presentation fit a patient who may be having a heart attack, and it is important to rule it out as soon as possible; right?
A. That’s correct.
Q. SO, you gave him an EKG in your office. And the EKG, you interpreted as normal; right?
A. Yes.
Q. And EKG can, if a patient has had a heart attack, show evidence of heart attack on the tracing, true?
A. Yes.
Q. Does it look like little gravestones on the tracing, if somebody has had a heart attack?

[The only point of the question is to show the witness and the jury that the examiner knows something about reading an EKG, which helps advance his own credibility.]
A. That is a classic presentation of a massive myocardial infarction, the tombstone sign, yes.
Q. And sometimes it could show ischemic heart disease, by an elevation of something called the ST wave?
A. Yes.
Q. But he had neither. He was a normal presentation on the EKG?
A. EKG was normal, yes.
Q. But that in and of itself does not rule out that he’s either had a heart attack, or that he’s in the process of having a heart attack; does it?
A. It is part of the process of working him up.
Q. But not the whole process?
A. It is the initial process.
Q. SO, when he’s in your clinic, you also gave him some, what was it, Maalox or some type of antacid drink?
A. Correct
Q. You heard Rana Epperly say that he threw that up; is that correct?
A. Yes.
Q. So, he wasn’t feeling good, right?
A. No. He didn’t look good, no.
Q. You also gave him a shot of Toradol, and it says IM, which means into a muscle.

[Always translating any technical words into plain English – “into a muscle” is better than “intra-muscular” – keeps the examination on a clear path.]
A. That’s correct. That was for his low back pain.
Q. But Toradol doesn’t just affect the low back, it is not a drug that says, I’m only going to touch the low back. When you put it in the muscle, it will help if you have pain anywhere.
A. That’s correct. But it was intended to help with the pain of his low back pain.
Q. In fact, if have you chest pain or mid-back pain, or whatever, the Toradol predictably will diminish pain, wherever it is.
A. The Toradol as a pain killer will affect the entire body, yes.
Q. But the Toradol doesn’t, if the pain subsides, rule out a heart attack; will it?
A. I did that for patient comfort.
Q. I understand that. But the Toradol don’t rule out if he’s having a heart attack?
A. No, it just makes the patient more comfortable.
Q. But you still have a concern he may have a immediately life-threatening problem?
A. You continue with the work up, yes.
Q. You know, have you heard the expression “masking symptoms”?
A. Yes.

[More non-leading questions enable the cross-examiner to make his point through the witness’s words.]
Q. With regard to the administration of pain medications, what does that mean?
A. If you give them a high enough pain medication, you could take any pain away.

[The witness has given a less-than-clear definition of what it means for a medication to “mask symptoms,” so the examiner gives his own definition.]
Q. One of the great things about the body is, that the pain is a warning sign not just to patients, but also to the doctors, so that they know what to look for?
A. That’s correct. That’s the reason that I gave him 30 milligrams of Toradol, rather than a narcotic such as Morphine or Demerol.
Q. One of the things you’re required to do, is not just recognize he’s in pain, but do a history of him and find out where the pain is, whether it is sudden onset, how severe it is, and does it radiate; is that correct?
A. That’s correct.
Q. You did find out that he had severe pain, and that it was chest, and low back. The low back, you said, was the most severe, and that it radiated to his mid-back; right?
A. That’s correct.
Q. But are you telling the jury, you didn’t determine whether this was sudden, and that is somehow important to this case?

[It doesn’t hurt to underline again the key point that the doctor had failed in his job to get an accurate history.]
A. The sudden onset of chest pain was not documented. I did not pick that up. It was a new onset. He did describe it as new onset. If he would have described it as sudden onset, that would have made a big difference, yes.

[The witness tries to push the blame for no “sudden onset” description onto the patient, and the cross-examiner shows he is instantly ready for the point.]
Q. But you’re the doctor. You’re the one that understands the significance. He comes in and says: I got this pain this morning, and I’m here, and I’m concerned. That’s basically what he said, right?
A. Yes.
Q. And you’re the doctor. You’re saying that if he had told you it was a sudden onset, that it would have made a big difference. What stopped you from asking him whether it was sudden?

[Is this risky? Not much. The attorney has already established that (1) the “sudden” nature of the pain would be key to know and (2) the witness didn’t recall asking about it specifically, so another non-leading question that basically asks “why didn’t you ask if it was sudden” is not one that leaves the witness any escape option, except to develop a new and non-credible memory that he did in fact ask the question.]
A. In getting the history, I asked: When did it start? I asked the severity of it. That’s where the eight out often came from. I asked: Does it go anywhere? In that, the patient will usually elicit — if it is there, they will tell me it was a sudden onset.
Q. I understand you don’t have that written down, and you don’t know whether he said sudden or not; but what stopped you from asking him anything?

[Good cross-examiners listen carefully to each answer. The witness did not directly answer the question, so asking it again keeps the witness on the hook. Persistence then pays off in the next few questions when the examiner gets the witness to admit that if he had asked the key question, he would have taken an entirely different path with the patient.]
A. I just knew it started that morning.
Q. But there was no reason that you couldn’t have asked him: Was this sudden?
A. I could have asked him, yes.
Q. You’re saying if you had asked him that question and he said it was sudden — we have no reason to suggest that he wouldn’t have said that because you heard what he said to Rana — all of a sudden, I’m walking down the street, and it felt like I had one of our horses stomp on my chest. Are you telling the jury, if he had said it was sudden, it would have made, in your words, “a big difference”?
A. Yes.
Q. Are you telling the jury that if he had said it was sudden, you would have worked him up for an aortic dissection?
A. According to the standard of care and everything that you’ve been seeing, yes.
Q. Let me ask you this question, sir. [You] made the determination that working him up in your clinic was not enough. You had to take him across the street. Did you personally walk him across the street?
A. Yes, I did.
Q. When you got across the street, you took him to the emergency room, and he filled out some forms. Were those filled out before you saw him, or did you go right in?
A. What forms are you talking about?
Q. Well, there are some hospital record forms that talked about his address and phone number and things like that. Did you go right into the emergency room with him without filling out the forms?
A. I had called the nurses to give them advanced notice that I was going to be coming over with a patient. And in the process of going over, he did get checked in by the nurse. The nurse asked him the questions to fill in the emergency room encounter.
Q. How quickly was he hooked up to another EKG in the emergency room?
A. I can’t recall the exact time, but it would have been within 30 minutes.
Q. Then in addition to the EKG — in addition to the EKG, you also administered some blood tests?
A. That’s correct.
Q. One of the blood tests was a troponin level; is that correct?
A. That’s correct.
Q. Tell the jury what troponin is, and why you give a patient who you want to exclude heart attack a troponin test?

[Here is another safe “why” question – asking the witness to explain why he did what he did when there are limited options for the witness to answer. The question invites the witness to explain things as a doctor would, and so the witness takes the bait.]
A. Troponin is an enzyme that is located within the cells of the heart, that is not found in the bloodstream, unless damage to the heart has occurred. When that happens, it leaks that enzyme out, and we are able to detect it in the bloodstream.
Q. Pretty sensitive; isn’t it?
A. Yes.
Q. But sometimes it takes a while for troponin, the troponin test to actually become positive; doesn’t it?
A. It could take up to four hours, sometimes.
Q. In fact, what you typically do, if you’re concerned about a heart attack, is administer a troponin test, and even if it is negative, you wait about four hours, and then give those again?
A. You can, yes.
Q. But you didn’t do that this time, did you?
A. There was enough time that had lapsed, with his presentation, I would have expected the troponin to have been elevated.
Q. When you brought him into the emergency room, you then filled out a history from him; didn’t you?
A. Yes.
Q. Exhibit 50, which you have in the book in front of you, and I have up here, this is the emergency room record, and it says “chest pain”. Is there a specific form that is used in the emergency room when a patient comes in with chest pain?
A. The one you’re looking at there.
Q. SO, there are different forms for different presentations?
A. Headaches, chest pain, kidney problems, yes.
Q. Okay. And it says: Chief complaint chest pain. Did you circle” chest pain”?
A. Yes.
Q. And it says: Started this a.m., is that handwriting?
A. That’s correct.
Q. Pressure, eight out of ten. Now, is ten — when you explain the pain scale of one to ten, what do you tell patients?
A. I tell them to base it upon a one — zero to ten scale. Zero is no pain, and ten is the worst pain ever.
Q. So, eight out of ten is worst, very severe pain; isn’t it?
A. Moderate to severe, yes.
Q. Moderate would be four, five. If ten is the worst pain ever, wouldn’t eight out often be close?
A. Four, 1 would say, would be mild to moderate. Eight would be moderate to severe.
Q. But the instructions that you give the patient were, zero is no pain, ten is the worst pain ever?
A. That’s correct.
Q. And so he hit 80 percent of the worst pain ever?
A. It was significant. This is a pressure, eight out of ten, no shortness of breath.
Q. Now, one thing that happens when you have a heart attack, is you can have shortness of breath, true?
A. You may or may not.
Q. No diaphoresis. Would you tell the jury what diaphoresis is?
A. Sweating.
Q. Plus LBP. That means, he also had low back pain?
A. That’s correct.
Q. Now, as far as the description of the pain, you have, this is a pressure, eight out of ten was the pain to describe the chest pain radiating to his mid-back; wasn’t it?
A. That’s correct.
Q. The low back pain, what was that, ten out of ten?
A. It was more severe, yes.
Q. More severe than an eight?
A. His complaint to the clinic when he showed up with the chest pain radiating to the back, and his low back pain, his low back pain was more severe.
A. Okay.
Q. He told you this pain was constant, and you checked constant, and it was still present. And then, under location of pain, you drew an arrow, and you drew those boxes; right?
A. Correct.
Q. The boxes are not on the form, you actually drew them on there; didn’t you?
A. Yes.
Q. And you drew a pressure right to the middle of the chest, and right underneath that is the heart, and coming off of the heart, is what?
A. The aorta.
Q. You drew a line also to the mid-back, and you wrote the word “radiation” on top?
A. That’s correct.
Q. And radiation, right through the mid-back and right under that little diagram in the mid-back; is what?
A. The aorta, along with the trachea, the esophagus, and part of the lung.
Q. Then you drew another line to the low back, and does the aorta go under that as well?
A. At the low back, no.
Q. Now, under here you have got, “onset during rest”; is that significant?
A. Can be.
Q. And in fact, if a patient has an aortic dissection, that does not have to happen when they are working out. It could just happen when they are asleep, or at rest, or whatever?
A. Also, with other chest pain, we have a lot of cardiac patients that come in with chest pain at rest. It actually wakes them up. They were sleeping.
Q. You put the number eight out often when seen in the emergency department, e.d. It is still eight out of ten, it has not gone down?
A. Right. This was immediately on arriving to the emergency room, you start to fill these forms out. These are getting filled as the nurses are taking the information from the patient for that emergency room encounter.
Q. But this is not the nurse, because this is your handwriting?
A. This is my handwriting, but I’m telling you all of this is happening at once.
Q. Okay. Then the next page of this, which is Page 2, describes the physical exam; right?
A. That correct.
Q. That exam, there are little checkmarks. Did you make those checkmarks’?
A. Yes.
Q. You fill out the EKG monitoring strip, “result NSR” means what?
A. Normal sinus rhythm.
Q. That is a normal test, right?
A. It is showing a normal sinus rhythm, right.
Q. In fact, you checked off: Reviewed by me, normal sinus rhythm, normal intervals, normal access, normal QRS — which are the Q waves — normal ST segments.
A. That’s correct.
Q. Then the chest x-ray, you have: Chest x-ray reviewed by me. As I told the jury, you did the initial review of the chest x-ray’?
A. Yes.
Q. And that was normal?
A. Yes.
Q. And KUB, which is another film you ordered,
A. Yes.
Q. And then there was an ultrasound, which was normal?
A. Read as normal, yes.
Q. The CBC, you read as normal. And then it says, except, and you have this slightly elevated Lipase?
A. Correct.
Q. You do agree, it is only slightly elevated; don’t you?
A. There is no dispute on that. Yes.
Q. All of these other tests. Troponin are normal. KCK, another enzyme to determine if there is any muscle damage. All of those are normal, right?
A. That’s correct.
Q. Then under clinical impression, it says chest pain, pericardial. And the word “pericardial” means?
A. It is anterior to the heart.
Q. There is a section here for acute aortic dissection, but that’s not circled; is it?
A. No.
Q. You do admit, that virtually every textbook of medicine that deals with the evaluation of chest pain, says you must include aortic dissection within the differential, especially when you’re dealing with a middle-aged man; true?
A. Chest pain in general, you would have to consider aortic dissection.
Q. In this case, we saw the diagram of the aorta, and it is sort of a candy-cane-type figure. If there is an aortic dissection, the pain can, in fact, as you heard from Dr. Magorien, Dr. Duran, and Dr. von Elten, radiate from the chest right to the back; true’?
A. True. And also, like your textbooks and journals, it could also radiate to the jaw, radiate to other body parts, cause signs and symptoms of a stroke, cause hoarse voice, cause problems swallowing. There is a multitude of symptoms. It is not that just that simple, of radiation to the back.
Q. You knew when you saw Mr. Epperly, that he had signs and symptoms which were consistent with aortic dissection; didn’t you?
A. Knew or know?
Q. You knew at the time that Mr. Epperly had this new onset of chest pain that morning, that it was severe, that it radiated to his back; and you knew at that time, that he had signs and symptoms which were consistent with aortic dissection. Whether he had one or not, you didn’t know, but you knew that they were consistent with aortic dissection?
A. That would be a no.
Q. You didn’t know that?
A. No. No. Could I expand on that a little bit?

[The witness remains under control, as shown by his asking permission to expand his answer. The cross-examiner shows fairness and control by postponing, but not denying, the witness’s desire to explain.]
Q. In a minute. Do you remember giving a deposition in this case?
A. Yes.
MR. LEVENTHAL: May I approach the witness, Your Honor.
THE COURT: You may. You may do so.
Q. (by Mr. Leventhal) Doctor, I’m going to hand you the original of your deposition.

THE COURT: The record will reflect the seal has been broken on the original.

[Another mark of a skilled cross-examiner is not rushing through the foundation for impeachment with a deposition. Stretching the foundational point here heightens suspense because everyone knows that a critical juncture has been reached.]
Q. (by Mr. Leventhal) This deposition was taken November 14, 2006; do you remember giving that deposition, sir?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you remember that when you gave the deposition, that you were under oath?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you remember that I told you that not only — and you were aware, that not only were you giving a deposition that was being taken down by a court reporter, but you were also videotaped?
A. That’s correct.
Q. And I told you that if you changed your testimony during the deposition or at trial, that change could be pointed out to the jury, for them to consider whether you were telling the truth?
A. Yes.
Q. I want you to turn — and you also had an opportunity to make corrections to that deposition; didn’t you?
A. Yes.
Q. But you made no corrections, did you?
A. No.
Q. I want you to turn to Page 115 of your deposition. I want you to read to yourself from Line 2 through Line 17. Just read that to yourself, quietly. Megan I would like for you to play for the jury, please, Line 2 through Line 17. (Dr. Perez’ Video Deposition and text, from November 14, 2006, was played, from Page 115 Line 2 to Page 115 Line 17, to the jury.)
Q. (by Mr. Leventhal) That was your testimony, wasn’t it?
A. I still hold to it. You’re reading into it maybe the wrong way. In the general differential, when people present with chest pain, the general differential of aortic dissection would be included. Above, I was telling you in my presentation, the patient, Mr. Epperly, at that point, no.
Q. Are you then saying to this jury, that Mr. Epperly told you he had a new onset of chest pain that morning, eight out of ten, radiating to his back, that he did not — is it your testimony now, that he did not have signs and symptoms consistent with aortic dissection when you saw him?
A. I’ve had many patients present with his similar symptoms, that have been through the same work-up he has, and they did not receive a CAT Scan. When we see a patient with a chief complaint of chest pain, whether it radiates or not, you are going to have in the big differential, the list that books will spit out at you, the ones that you carry with you at all times, aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection would be there. Very quickly, as you assess the patient, you tailor a differential that is specific for that patient.
Q. Now, would you answer my question, sir. Would you like me to repeat it?

[The witness has strayed beyond the question to try out his defense. Again, rather than moving to strike the answer as non-responsive, which involves the judge and shows weakness, the cross-examiner instead simply asks the witness to return to the question asked.]
A. Go ahead.
Q. Are you telling the jury when you saw Mr. Epperly, who told you that he had a new onset, maybe sudden, of chest pain, eight out of ten, radiating to his back, that he did not have signs and symptoms consistent with aortic dissection?
A. For my tailored differential diagnosis for him at that point, no. If that would have been part of the tailored differential diagnosis for him, a CT would have been ordered.
Q. Turn to page 143 of your deposition, please. I want you to look at lines 8 through 12. Read those to yourself. Megan, please, play for the jury Lines 8 through 12.
(Dr. Perez’ Video Deposition with text was played from Page 143 Line 8 to Page 143 Line 12 to the jury.)
Q. That was your testimony at the time under oath, true?
A. True.
Q. Now, you took him across the street. You get the EKG. You did the chest x-ray. You did no tests. You did no tests which would have ruled out aortic dissection; true?
A. There was no test done to rule out an aortic dissection, true.
Q. There was a CT Scan in the hospital; wasn’t there? A CT Scanner?
A. Yes.
Q. And if you wanted to order a CT for Mr. Epperly with contrast, that could have been done?
A. If an indication was present for a CT, a CT would have been done, and could have been done, yes.
Q. The only risk to Mr. Epperly, was a very small, as you described it, minimal amount of radiation?
A. Correct.
Q. What would it have taken, a couple of minutes?
A. About five.
Q. Five minutes?
A. Five or ten minutes.
Q. SO a five-minute CT Scan, and Mr. Epperly would be alive today, right?
A. With what we know today, in hindsight, he probably would be alive today, yes.

[The witness had already admitted, early in the examination, that a CT scan would have saved the patient’s life. But here, adding the new detail about the amount of time a CT scan would have taken makes the repetition fresh and non-boring: Not just that a CT scan would have saved his life, but a five-minute CT.]
Q. I have shown you the book which says that the signs and symptoms are consistent, you must rule it out and do it immediately, and that chest x-ray is not enough. But there is almost an identical statement in the ACLS book; isn’t there?

[The question about the ACLS book circles back to the witness’s training as ACLS-certified.]
A. You see that multiple times. The key phrases are, “if” there are signs and symptoms that are consistent, “if”.
Q. SO, the ACLS book, let me make sure I get this exactly right. Given Mr. Epperly’s presentation, given his age, and given the fact that he was a smoker, that part of a work-up would be required for you to do, would be to work him up for the possibility of an aortic aneurysm or rupture under the ACLS book, true?
A. If it is indicated, yes.
Q. Actually, what the ACLS book says, for a patient like him, chest pain radiating to the back, they have to be worked up for an aortic aneurysm; that is what it says, doesn’t it?
A. No. It is their recommendation. There are hundreds of thousands of patients that have chest pain radiating to the back, that do not get CAT Scans.

[The witness has just made a seemingly strong point, putting the patient among “hundreds of thousands” of others who don’t get CT scans. This could have stopped a lesser examiner cold, but Leventhal is ready, because the key difference goes back to chronic pain versus sudden, new pain.]
Q. But we are not talking about just chest pain radiating to the back. We’re not talking about somebody that has had it for months or years. As you put it 20 minutes ago, if he told you that it was sudden, you would have given him a CAT Scan?
A. That would have made a big difference, yes.
Q. Basically, what you’re telling the jury is: If you had asked Mr. Epperly, was this sudden? And knowing what you know today, he would have said, yes; he would be alive today.
A. In hindsight, if he would have conveyed the information, if I would have asked him, if he would have said “sudden”. it would have a dramatic difference.
Q. Dramatic is an understatement; isn’t it? He would be alive?
A. Yes, potentially.
Q. You don’t know whether you asked him. You can’t say sit there and say, he didn’t tell you that it was sudden. All you know, is that you didn’t write it down?
A. All I know, is that started that morning.

[Now the examiner asks the witness the ultimate question. Rather than using lawyer talk – “you breached the standard of care” – he uses the more forceful and direct, “your care was substandard.”]
Q. Do you admit then, if in fact Mr. Epperly told you, in addition to the fact that it started that morning — do you admit to this jury, if he told you that, your care was substandard?
A. My care would have been modified to include a CT in the work-up, if I would have gotten the sudden component of the chest pain.

[Note how the witness has dodged the most damning admission, making only the lesser admission that his care would have changed. The examiner persists and then finally obtains the damning admission.]
Q. I get that part. I want to know whether you admit it. You told me, if you got the information that it was a sudden onset of chest pain, that you would have done a CT?
A. It–
Q. My question is, sir, if in fact you did get that information, if in fact Mr. Epperly said exactly what he told Rana, when she said that she heard, when she was in the emergency room, it came on while he was walking, felt like a — like his Belgian stepped on his chest. If he told you that and you didn’t do a CT, do you admit to this jury, that your care was substandard?
A. If it was sudden, and I did not do a CT, a CT should have been included in the work up.
Q. So you admit it?
A. From a sudden standpoint?
Q. Yes.
A. It should have been included in the work up.
Q. And do you admit, sir, that because patients who come in, they might not even know what the aorta is. And even if they do, they may not know what is a sign of a problem with the aorta, that was your job, not Mr. Epperly’s job, to ask him if it was sudden.

[Having received the critical admission, the examiner closes off the one tiny escape still remaining, that it could be the patient’s fault for not saying “sudden.”]
A. Yes, I’m not blaming anybody for that. In the history of pain, there was a new onset of chest pain.
Q. But it was your job to ask him, because it was so important to you, it was your job to ask him if it was sudden, not Mr. Epperly’s job to tell you, it’s your job to ask him.
A. Yes, I’m not blaming Mr. Epperly.
Q. Do you know why the ACLS was published?
A. As recommendation guidelines to work up chest pain and other cardiac issues.
Q. Actually, it was published, and I believe that these are your words: To provide a certain standard of care for patients. Do you remember saying that?
A. I read it.
Q. Well, but you read it —
A. What I had said, yes, correct.
Q. — but–
A. Yes, I read it, yes.
Q. One of the purposes, and the main purpose of the ACLS, was so patients’ problems would not be missed. That was one of the reasons, right?
A. To do a complete work up, yes.
Q. In fact your word was: It gives you a standard, your words, a standard to follow.
A. Yes.
Q. And the reason for that is so that patients’ problems would not be missed; right?
A. Yes.
Q. That’s one of the reasons for the ACLS guidelines?
A. They are guidelines to help you, yes, in medical decision making.
Q. And in fact it provides a standard approach for patients who present with certain signs and symptoms; doesn’t it?
A. Yes.
Q. And what it does, it takes away the judgment of the physician, so that the patient can’t say — so the physician can’t say, yes, he has chest pain. He has pain radiating down his arms, and all of these problems, but in m)! judgment, it is not a heart attack, it is something else. The ACLS took away that judgment to make sure that physicians weren’t missing a problem, true?
A. ACLS guidelines are guidelines. The book when you certify every two years they tell you, these are not intended to serve the position of the physician, but they are there as guidelines.
Q. My question, sir, was: The ACLS took away the judgment, to make sure that physicians were not missing a problem; true?
A. You still need to use your medical judgment.
Q. Turn to Page 114, please, of your deposition. I’m sorry, Page 111. On Page 111 I asked you virtually the same questions that I asked you now.

Line 10: Did you know why the ACLS was ever published?
Your answer: To provide a certain standard of care for patients.

Question: So patients’ problems would not be missed. That is one of the reasons; right? Answer: It gives you a standard to follow, yes.

Question, by me: So patients’ problems weren’t missed, right?

Answer: That is one.

Question: That is one of the reasons for the ACLS guidelines?

Answer: You would hope so.

In fact, it provides a standardized approach to patients who present for certain signs and symptoms, doesn’t it?

You said: Yes.

And question: ACLS does?

Answer, you said: Yes.

And my question to you: And what it does is takes away the judgment of a physician, so that a physician can’t say, well, gee, he’s got chest pain, he’s got radiating down his arm, he’s got all of these problems, but in my judgment, it is not a heart attack, it is something else. The ACLS took away that judgment to make sure physicians were not missing a problem, true?
And your answer was: They were there to try and make that not happen, yeah, to lessen the risk, correct.
A. To lessen the risk, yes.
Q. You looked at the chest x-ray and you read it as normal. You didn’t have a radiologist in the hospital at the time that you looked at the chest x-ray, did you?
A. No.
Q. What is the situation with radiologists at Kit Carson, if you need one to read a film STAT, or immediately, what do you do?
A. In 2003, you could scan it or digitize it and send it over the internet. The radiologist stated that is not appropriate for them. It affects the quality of the read, and they could not stand behind the read, but they would still read it for you with the understanding that they may change the reading once they see it in person.
Q. SO, this was a Friday. September 19 was a Friday, and you didn’t digitize it or try to scan it and send it over the internet?
A. No, the x-ray looked normal to me.
Q. Okay. But you did discharge Mr. Epperly–
A. Yes.
Q. — on the 19th. And you heard Mrs. Epperly tell the jury, that Mr. Epperly didn’t want to go home?
A. He did not voice that. There was no comment made about him not wanting to leave. If anything, Mrs. Epperly did a very good job of convincing him to let me finish the work up.
Q. He never said anything, it feel like I’m dying, or there is something wrong; he didn’t use those words?
A. Not directly with him. The first time I had heard those words. was the first time he came in after the aortic dissection ruptured, his wife told me those words, her husband had felt, or the premonition of doom or dying.
Q. You heard Mrs. Epperly say and it is in her posting fourteen days, or thirteen days after Mr. Epperly’s death, you told them this was not life threatening, or words to that affect, and that she heard you say that at least three times. Do you admit saying that to them?
A. As I had told you in my deposition, I do not recall. I would have to rely on the recent information. She typed this out 13 or 14 days after the event. I would have to give her the benefit of the doubt. This memory of 13 days out, is better than 6 years out.
Q. Then you think that you probably did say that because that is what she wrote?

[The witness has made the concession, but the cross-examiner stretches the point to make it clear to the jury.]
A. Again, I probably don’t recall, but with her information there, I would have to give her the benefit of the doubt.
Q. Given the fact that aortic dissection is within the differential, you didn’t put it in, but you admit it would be, how do you tell somebody it is not life threatening before you do a CT Scan?
[Another non-leading question is safe here because it replows old ground, and the question produces a dramatic concession, albeit hedged with the “hindsight” defense.]
A. It was based on my initial history and examination of Mr. Epperly. If I said that that is what it would be based upon. In hindsight, with what we know today, we obviously know that is very wrong.

[Now that the witness has come back to his only defense of “hindsight,” the examiner punctures the defense by going to the rules set out in the literature.]
Q. One of the reasons you don’t want to look at things in hindsight, you don’t want to be faced with a misdiagnosis which costs a patient their life; right?
A. Correct.
Q. One of the reasons for the rules, if the signs and symptoms are consistent with aortic dissection, you must work it up so that you don’t wind up looking at something in hindsight and saying, Oh, no. Oh, my God. I missed it. That is the purpose of the rule, to be sure that don’t happen; right?
A. Designed to help assess them. It is not perfect. That is why they call it the art of medicine.
Q. It is actually only perfect if the doctor follows the rule. But if he breaks the rule, things like this happen; true?
A. Even if the doctor follows the rules, you could still have bad outcomes.
Q. But not in this case. Because if you had followed the rule which says, that if the patient’s history or examination is consistent with aortic dissection, the imaging studies to evaluate the patient must be pursued; if you had done that and you had done the CT, he would be alive?
A. Would probably be alive. There is no guarantee on that.

[Again, persistent polite questioning leaves the witness’s hindsight defense looking weak.]
Q. On Monday, the 22d, you met with Dr. Harrington?
A. Correct. During my hospital rounds, 1would routinely go to the radiology reading room where the radiologists gather in the mornings to read the films that had occurred from last week and over the weekend.
Q. Was there typically a radiologist there on a Friday?
A. If they were there, they were in there in the morning, and they would leave by around noon. But it didn’t necessarily mean they would have to be there. Their schedule, I don’t keep track of, so.
Q. You met with Dr. Harrington, who actually came in, drove in to do a shift at Kit Carson?
A. Yes.
Q. How many days a week would she do that?
A. Again, I — once, twice a week. I’m not quite sure. I couldn’t tell you.
Q. Dr. Harrington and you discussed the x-ray. Tell the jury what Dr. Harrington said to you about the x-ray?
A. I presented the case to her. I wanted to take a look at the x-rays. The way that she read the x-ray was normal. She made a comment about how the aorta was tortuous. but that can be a norn1aI variant. That is the way that she described it to me.
Q. You also knew that it could be a normal variant in an older person, but for someone Mr. Epperly’s age, it would be unusual for the aorta to look tortuous?
A. It’s still within a normal variant, and this is her words. not mine.
Q. Was my statement true?
A. About what?
Q. That you knew, on September 22, 2003, that it was not unusual for an aorta to look tortious in an older person, older than 41, someone in their 60s to 70s; but that it was unusual, may still be within a normal range, but it was unusual for it to look tortuous in a41-year-old?
A. It was more likely to be unusual in an older person than a younger person, yes.
Q. You said that you presented the case to her. Did you give her the medical record to review?
A. It was a verbal presentation. I don’t carry medical records with me.
Q. So, you didn’t have the medical records when she was doing this. She would just have your verbal presentation?
A. Correct.
Q. Did you document what you told her anywhere?
A. We don’t routinely do that, no.
Q. And what did you tell her?
A. I told her that a 41-year-old male, chest pain, come in. I had told her the work up we did. I said, would you mind taking a look at the x-rays, the KUB, and ultrasound, and see if you agree with all of the initial readings.
Q. Is that your best recollection of what you told her?
A. That is not the exact words, but the gist of it, yes.
Q. SO, is it correct that she didn’t see the diagram which shows the chest pain radiating to the back?
A. No.
Q. Was my statement correct?
A. She did not see the diagram, no. Radiologist usually, all they get is an x-ray with a patient’s name, date of birth, and maybe one word on a complaint, and that is it.
Q. What you told her was, this was a 41 -year-old man with chest pain, but you didn’t tell her about the back pain?
A. The back pain would have more than likely have been included, yes.
Q. Do you know whether you told her about the back pain?
A. I would imagine so, yes.
Q. Do you know?
A. I would have to say, yes.
Q. Actually, you don’t know whether you said back pain or not, just like you don’t know whether you said this is not life threatening to the Epperlys. It’s a long time.
A. You learn, when you regurgitate histories, to keep things in mind. And this radiation to the back, would have been included in the presentation to Dr. Harrington.
Q. Did you tell Dr. Harrington that Mr. Epperly did not have health insurance?
A. I don’t recall if I discussed health insurance with her or not. Usually, from my standpoint, it doesn’t make an issue whether they have health insurance or not.
Q. In fact, you have no recollection of telling, no reason to have told Dr. Harrington that Mr. Epperly didn’t have health insurance; did you?
A. That would not affect the decision as to what to do, if there is anything else to do, no.
Q. I’m not asking that. I’m not asking whether it would affect the decision. I’m asking you whether you concede that there was no reason for you to tell the radiologist that this man did not have insurance?
A. We don’t usually discuss insurance issues with radiologists. We discuss the case. We don’t normally bring up, Oh, they have Blue Cross Blue Shield, or uninsured, they are on Medicaid. We don’t usually discuss that, no.
Q. You never had a discussion with Mr. Epperly where he said, I don’t want to pay for expensive tests; did you?
A. No.
Q. That is clear in your mind. He never said, I don’t want the CT Scan, I don’t want tests, because I can’t afford them. Those words or anything like it never came out of his mouth, true?
A. Correct.
Q. You were aware when Dr. Harrington told you that it appears tortuous, that it means that it may be a little unusual; right?
A. Twisted, yes.
Q. You knew that one reason that a patient can have an aorta that appears to be kind of twisted, or unusual, is an aortic dissection?
A. It can be, yes.
Q. So, you knew when you saw him, saw Mr. Epperly, when you were talking to Dr. Harrington, that signs and symptoms which were consistent with an aortic aneurysm, or problems with the aorta. You knew that. The doctor is telling you, the radiologist is telling you, that the aorta looks tortious. And that can happen when there is dissection. You knew that. You didn’t need her to tell you to do an additional study. That was your job; true?
A. I did not know that. If I had known that, I
Q. You did not know what?
A. What you were saying, that I knew that he had aortic dissection. That I knew that he needed – had I knew that, I would not have requested or required her recommendation to get a CT. If I had known that, I would have got a CT that Friday.
Q. I’m sorry, you misunderstood me. I apologize if it was not clear. Let me restart. When you were talking to Dr. Harrington, you knew that Mr. Epperly had signs and symptoms that would have been consistent with an aortic dissection — you didn’t know he had one — but you knew that he fell within the general differential; right?
A. Again, when you assess the patient initially, in the general differential, you would have aortic dissection in place. With his modified differential, when I did his history and assessment, it was no longer there. If it was still there, I would have ordered the CAT Scan on Friday.
Q. I want you to, if you would please, turn to Page 142 of your deposition. I want you to read to yourself Page 142 Line 6, through Page 144 Line 6. Megan, would you please play for the jury Page 142 Line 6 through Page 144 Line 6.

MS. DOIG: Your Honor, if I could have a minute to read through this, there are a number of objections. I want to be sure that—
THE COURT: If you will hold off until we deal with those.

MS. DOIG: No objection. (Dr. Perez’ Video Deposition with text was played from Page 142 Line 6 to Page 144 Line 6.)
Q. So, you’re not blaming Dr. Harrington for the misdiagnosis; are you?
A. No, not directly.
Q. — or indirectly. It was your job to put it together. It was your job to recognize and put this whole picture together. She pointed out the tortuosity. It was your job to determine what to do with it. It was not her fault; is it?
A. She failed to make additional recommendations that then she supposedly verbalized in her deposition that had happened between her and I; but no, she is not directly responsible, and I’m not directly blaming her, no.
Q. She didn’t need to. As I had pointed out, she didn’t need to make those recommendations. You knew that a CT was the only way to rule it out; right?
A. CT is the way to rule out aortic dissection, yes.

[The examiner makes sure the witness does not shift the blame elsewhere.]
Q. You knew that. You didn’t need her to tell you that, right?
A. Correct.
Q. You knew the signs and symptoms of an aortic dissection. You didn’t need her to tell you that?
A. No.
Q. Correct?
A. Correct.
Q. You knew that after she told that you the aorta looked different for a 41-year-old man, tortuous, you knew it could be aortic dissection, you didn’t need her to tell you that; right?
A. It could, yes.
Q. I have shown the jury this on several occasions, but these are your words; aren’t they? Even if there is just a chance that someone may have a life-threatening condition, you want to rule that out, so that they don’t die while you’re thinking it may be something else; right? And you said, Correct. That is the standard of care, isn’t it? Answer: That is the way that you approach patients. Those were your words, weren’t they?

[The witness is asked to reaffirm in his own words that life-threatening conditions must be ruled out to comply with the standard of care. This sets up the next line of questions, where the witness is forced to disagree with his own official summary of the case read to the jury at the start of the trial.]
A. That’s correct.
Q. At the beginning of this trial, the Court read an instruction for the jury. Bear with me for a moment. I want to get a copy of that. It set forth your position in this case, in the instructions, and I’m asking the Court to take judicial notice of that, because it is now part of the trial.
THE COURT: This was the joint statement of the case?
MR. LEVENTHAL: Right. We’ve prepared the upper part, and defense prepared this part.
THE COURT: Understood.
Q. (by Mr. Leventhal) It says, although Dr. Perez did consider an aortic dissection, based upon Mr. Eppley’s presentation, the probability of this diagnosis was not sufficient to warrant additional testing. That’s your official position in this case, now, can you tell me how you take that position, and at the same time say, even if there is — or agree, that even if there is just a chance that someone may have a life-threatening condition, you want to rule that out so they don’t die, while you’re thinking that it may be something else. The probability was not high enough? But if there is chance they may have it, you rule it out. They just don’t fit; do they?

[The witness is forced to walk back his attorney’s official description of the case which used the term “probability” unwisely.]
A. What I would correct that statement to, with regard to the probability, when you are assessing a patient with chest pain, with or without radiation, you will make within the first few minutes of that patient’s encounter, a differential diagnosis, that if it includes an aortic dissection, you would do a CT; if it don’t, you would not.
Q. Doctor, it is a little late to correct the statement, because it became part of the case when it was read to the jury. It is your official position in this case. So, tell the jury, by percentages, what the probability was. Was it 10 percent? Was it 20 percent? We have heard probability when we talked earlier with the jury, that probability begins at 51 percent. What was the probability that Mr. Epperly was having an aortic dissection when you saw him, that was not high enough to justify a five-minute CT? Two percent, five percent, ten percent, what was it?
A. Based upon the books and literature provided, that you provide, it would be one percent or less.

[The witness’s answer finally puts the examiner back on the ropes, as he has no ready rejoinder to the assertion that the patient had a one percent or less chance of having the fatal condition. But watch the examiner recover with more questions.]
Q. That’s true of any patient, even with classic signs and symptoms; right?
A. Right.
Q. In fact, the books that we provide are all chest pain patients, not chest pain patients with radiation to the back, not chest pain patients when you start limiting it down to a 41-year-old man. Do you know what this probability was for him?
A. Precise, no, I don’t.
Q. But you do admit that there was a chance?
A. There is always a chance, always. There is always a possibility. I mean, that is the uncertainty of medicine.
Q. I’m not talking about always. I’m not talking about the situation where one of these people here, there is always a chance they may be in the process of having an aortic dissection, or I might be. I’m talking about a person that presents with a new onset of chest pain — as he described it, sudden, radiating to his back, right where the aorta is — that person, certainly at the minimum, had a chance that they were in the process of suffering an aortic dissection; true?
A. The possibility is there; yes.
Q. So, when you, given your admission, and given your statement in the deposition, that the standard of care is to rule it out so that they don’t die while you’re thinking it is something else, and you didn’t do that, you admit to the jury that your care, because there was a chance that this man was having an aortic dissection, given his presentation, that because you didn’t rule it out, don’t you admit that your care was substandard, truthfully?
A. In my heart, I still believe that the care provided for Mr. Epperly was appropriate.

[The witness still won’t admit his care was substandard. But watch how the examiner persists.]
Q. We heard, and there was a discussion during jury selection, that a doctor can exercise his judgment; but he shouldn’t do that until after he does all of the tests. You exercised your judgment before you got the CT; didn’t you?
A. Correct.
Q. That was before you got the critical tests?
A. Meaning the CAT Scan?
Q. Yes.
A. Yes.

[Now the examiner comes back to the issue of taking away any chance of finding out if the patient had the life-threatening issue, but adds to it a new element: the failure to disclose the option of a further test to the patient.]
Q. So, you took away any chance of finding out whether Mr. Epperly had this life-threatening problem, by making the decision for him, without telling him, without giving him the option that he shouldn’t have a CT; right?
A. Based upon his history and his physical examination, yes.
Q. His history did not rule out an aortic aneurysm; did it?
A. Again, with the presentation, the new onset, not knowing if it was sudden, that plays a role.

[Recess]
Q. Did his history rule out aortic aneurysm?
A. His history made it less of a chance, yes. It made it less of a probability.
Q. What part of the history makes it less of a probability? He says, I have this chest pain radiating to my back, it came on this morning. Even if he didn’t say that it was sudden, and there was good evidence that he did. Even if he didn’t say it was sudden, what part of that reduces the chance that it is not an aortic dissection or aneurysm?
A. The classic symptoms that you talk about, the sudden onset, the tearing sensation, and the relentlessness.
Q. It was relentless — it never went away. It was constant in your office. It was the same at the hospital. It was the same four days later.
A. It improved at the hospital, and when he presented to the clinic on the 23d, it was still the same as when he left the hospital, but it was not in the same condition that he presented on Friday.
Q. Doctor, when he was in the hospital and you said that it improved, you had just given him Toradol; correct?
A. Toradol lasts four to six hours. maximum. When I saw him on Tuesday, it was much later.
Q. But you gave it, and he came in on Tuesday, you’re saying it was improved. Let’s see what you wrote for Tuesday. Let’s go to Page 25 — Exhibit 25, Page 8, please. This is the note that you dictated at that time, right?
A. Correct.
Q. Within minutes of seeing him?
A. Yes.
Q. So you write, patient presents today for follow-up on his chest pain. Since his last visit, he continues with the pain, pretty much constant. There all of the time. It does not worsen or improve. Activity does not make it any worse. Can you show me where in the note it says that it is the same improved chest pain that it was after — when he left the emergency room?
A. If it would have been worse, he would have told me he was worse.
Q. I didn’t ask you that, sir. It says, is the same. Right? You would assume the same as when he left the emergency room, not the same as when he had the first encounter on Friday. Did you ask him to rate the chest pain on a scale of one to ten’!
A. No.
Q. So, did you ask him, and the chest pain was eight out of ten, because he said it is the same. Are you saying, that if he had said it was the same, you would have done a CT?
A. Probably not. The other thing that you notice with him, an improvement in his general exam when I had initially saw him on Friday, he was standing, pacing about in the exam room. Tuesday, he was sitting in the chair, his legs crossed, giving me this information. He was appearing and looking much more comfortable.
Q. I have a question about that. I have a question. If a chest x-ray, which is a radiographic study that looks into the chest, right in the area where the aorta is, is not sufficient to rule out an aortic dissection; how can you claim that by looking at him, that you can make the decision that he didn’t have an aortic dissection?
A. I’m claiming, by looking at him, that he was improved.
Q. Are you telling the jury that because he was improved, you decided not to do a CT? Because that’s what you told us in your deposition. You saw a man who comes in that morning, says: Follow-up on chest pain. Since his last visit continues with the pain, pretty much constant. There all of the time. Are you saying because he looked improved, which you didn’t note, that you decided not to do a CT?
A. On my general exam. General is just looking at the patient. General is unremarkable, rather than standing, pacing, looking uncomfortable.
Q. Turn to Exhibit 1, Page 20 for me, please.
A. Exhibit 1, page 20.
Q. Doctor, that is the note that you dictated after Mr. Epperly died. At this point, you knew you had missed an aortic dissection.
A. The diagnosis became more apparent with the chest x-ray, yes.
Q. You knew you had missed it. That was what was going on the whole time. You knew you missed it, and you wrote this note.
A. I had dictated events of the ER and the history, yes.
Q. And it was your opportunity to document that, not only what you saw, but your reason for not working him up, not doing the CT; right?
A. To document the events of the things that took place.
Q. Part of this note — would you enlarge the bottom part for the jury, please. Says: I saw him as a follow-up again today in the clinic. I noted that he was doing about the same, no worse, no better. He had taken it easy over the weekend, not really doing much activity. He had cut back on his coffee intake. He had been drinking 20 pots of coffee a day, and cut back down to 2 cups. There were no overall significant changes. That was dictated the night that he died.
A. Yes.
Q. When you dictated that, you didn’t write in there that he was improved from when you first saw him, did you?
A. No.
Q. The 20 pots of coffee a day, you’re not claiming the reason that you failed to do a CT Scan, was because he had this history of coffee intake; are you?
A. The coffee no, by itself, no.
Q. Do you agree when you have a person like this, that about 50 percent of the time, only about 50 percent of the time, there is a description of this tearing pain when there is an aortic dissection; is that your understanding of the literature?
A. That is what has been brought up, yes.
Q. You knew that in 2003, just because you don’t have a history that the patient had tearing pain, does not mean that they are not having an aortic dissection; you knew that, didn’t you?
A. There are many variables in the presentation, yes.
Q. So, you’re not going to claim — you’re not going to say that because he didn’t have tearing pain, that was an excuse for not doing a CT, that is not going to be your defense, right?
A. It played a role, yeah. It played a role in my decision making, yes.
Q. Is that the reason that you didn’t do a CT?
A. That was part of it, again, you look at the total picture.
Q. But you knew that 50 percent of the patients will have no tearing pain. In fact, Doctor, after you saw Mr. Epperly, and after he died, you saw a man who just had chest pain, no back pain, and you decided to send him for a CT, and what did you find?
A. I didn’t follow up myself, personally. I was consulted on it. He had a connective tissue disorder consistent with Marfan’s. They are at higher risk for aortic dissections. He had a CT done, and an aortic dissection or aneurysm was detected.
Q. And that not only didn’t have tearing pain, he didn’t have pain radiating to his back; right?
A. Correct.
Q. And that man, who you saw after Mr. Epperly, he had a history of connective tissue disease, and didn’t have the tearing pain, didn’t have radiation to his back; but because there was a chance he may have an aortic dissection, you sent him for CT, it was identified, and he survived; true?
A. Correct. He had a CT done, and the priority was his Marfan’s syndrome, the connective tissue disorder that greatly increases the risk of aortic dissection.
Q. Mr. Epperly was a smoker, doesn’t that increase the risk of aortic dissection?
A. It increases the risk of coronary artery disease, arterial sclerosis. But based upon the literature that you have, there is no direct link to smoking.
Q. You’re not claiming because he was a smoker, that is somehow an excuse for not doing a CT’?
A. Smoking will play a role, maybe, in heart disease, but not directly in aortic dissection.
Q. The approach to a patient is a step-by-step approach; is it not?
A. Yes.
Q. And the first thing that you do, is rule out heart disease, heart attack; right?
A. Correct.
Q. You were aware that an EKG generally will not rule out aortic dissection; correct?
A. In general, yes.
Q. But sometimes, an EKG will reveal an aortic dissection, if the dissection starts at the aortic valve, coronary artery?
A. If it affects the valves that feed the heart, yes.
MR. LEVENTHAL: Your Honor, may we approach the bench for a moment. Before we go into this, I would like the Court’s permission to do something.

THE COURT: It may be time to take a break. Okay. We’ll go ahead and take a brief recess, in any event, let’s go for about 15 minutes or so. We will stand in recess. You’re welcome to step out. (A recess was then taken.) (The following proceedings were had, out of the presence of the jury.)
THE COURT: Court is back in session, 08CR165 All parties and counsel are present. The jury is not present. Are we going to be ready to go, or are we going to need to make some adjustments before we resume?
MR. LEVENTHAL: What happened, I had requested to approach the bench. I did that because before I asked Dr. Perez about his evaluation on Monday, and the fact that he did not work up Mr. Epperly for MI on Monday, and that his expert believes that that was substandard care on his part, I had wanted to clear that with the Court. I had, during the testimony of Dr. von Elten, pointed out to the Court, that when Dr. von Elten had — I believe it was both Dr. von Elten and Dr. Duran — said that — and Dr. Perez admitted, that during the work up an MI — when you do an EKG, while in most cases, the EKG will be normal for an aortic dissection, the aortic dissection can be abnormal? depending on where the dissection starts.
THE COURT: The EKG can be abnormal?
MR. LEVENTHAL: I mean EKG.
THE COURT: I may be confused.
MR. LEVENTHAL: Sure. It also goes to this step-by-step approach. You start with heart attack and move to aortic dissection. There are many reasons why, when the doctor says that his care was appropriate, it wasn’t. His own expert says that it was not appropriate. I could wait until Dr. Watz is on the witness stand. Or I just want permission, if I decide to do this with Dr. Perez, that I don’t get in trouble for doing it, and I don’t cause a mistrial.

THE COURT: Ms. Doig?
MS. DOIG: Well, I object to those types of questions. I think we need to hear what Dr. Watz actually says on the witness stand, before any reference is made to what he says. Do you know what I mean?
THE COURT: Well, I do.
MS. DOIG: I mean, he said one thing in his deposition, I don’t think that he will testify inconsistently with his deposition. But I may choose not to even go to the 23d, and then there would be no questions about that, because it might be beyond the scope. My argument, frankly, I have not even thought about all of that. That is next week, in my mind, mentally. My argument, though, is consistent with what I have been saying before. Before that, there is no evidence that an aorta –an EKG on the 23d, would have led to a CT, which would have made a difference in the ultimate outcome. You know, whether or not an EKG is normal or not normal, there is still no evidence that a CT should have been ordered on the 23d, due to a further additional cardiac work up.
MR. LEVENTHAL: I already have his expert saying that a CT should have ordered on the 23d. That’s a given. Those people say that, but the issue is, whether or not an additional cardiac work-up should have been done on the 23d.
MR. LEVENTHAL: The semantics that we are going to be presenting to the Court, as Ms. Doig is saying, that in order for me to get this in, I have to show that an EKG would have revealed an aortic dissection. In order for her to make that statement, she has to ask you to … the holdings in People versus Ramirez. People versus Ramirez does not require that for evidence to be presented, that there is a 100 percent certainty that a test would be positive and show evidence of an aortic dissection. People versus Ramirez does not require it to even be probable. It only requires that there be a possibility. And in this case, even without Ramirez, because we are dealing with medicine. All we have to do is show that it is possible that an EKG would have revealed this, and that it was substandard care for him not to do an MI work-up and do an EKG; and because of that, an opportunity was missed. For her to suggest that she might not even ask the doctor those questions, I think, once again, we get the doctor on the witness stand, and he says that in his opinion the care was appropriate, within the standard of care, and he can be cross-examined. I think the cross-examination cannot be limited, because she chooses to cut off his care on the 19th. and not include the 23d.
THE COURT: Presumably, you could call him as an adverse witness for that, I would presume.
MR. LEVENTHAL: Absolutely, and I would.
THE COURT: I mean, I’ve done it for a while. I’ve not read Dr. Watz’ deposition. First, let me make sure I have access to it. I think it is among the exhibits, but I want to be sure of that.
MR. LEVENTHAL: We could give you a copy if you don’t have it. It looks like Exhibit 47.
THE COURT: Is it on one of the discs? We will get it. I have a copy of it
MR. LEVENTHAL: Could I get the exhibit, I think the court reporter has it, which was Exhibit 66, for use?
THE COURT: Yes, we have it. Are you talking about the Triple A Tragedy?
MR. LEVENTHAL: Yes.
THE COURT: I’m handing it to you.
MR. LEVENTHAL: Thank you. I am ready to go then.
THE COURT: I will take a look at that depo, and we will have to look at this argument. I might even wait until he testifies. Let me at least read the depo, and then we’ll try to go forward. You may be seated, please. All right. (The following proceedings were had to a jury of six and two alternates.)
THE COURT: The jury has now returned to the courtroom. Dr. Perez, you’re still under oath.
Q. (by Mr. Leventhal) Doctor, I want to clarify one thing. That is, this chest pain, back pain that was eight out of ten refers to the chest pain and mid-back pain. The pain was higher than eight out often?
A. Correct.
Q. He had mid-back pain, eight out of ten, and chest pain eight out of ten, and low back pain higher?
A. More severe, yes.
Q. Can I ask that the court reporter make a note of this part of the transcript. I’m going to ask you to do something later with this. Doctor, you said that his history was not consistent with aortic dissection; do you recall him saying that?
A. Yes.
Q. And then you told us the thing that was missing, was sudden onset. If this were present, it would have made it consistent?
A. It would have made a big difference, yes.
Q. Now, you also told us that you give a lot of weight and a lot of credibility to the posting that Rana Epperly did on October 3, 2003, because it was within 13 or 14 days after Mr. Epperly’s death?
A. Her memory, recollection, would be better than mine would be six years later on this subject, yes.
Q. I have Exhibit 66 up, and it says — and this is an exhibit that is going to the jury — that on Friday, September 19, my husband left the house to run some errands in town. At 11 :00 a.m., I received a call from our doctor, stating that John had come into the office about chest pain, and he was being admitted to the ER for further tests. He told me, upon arrival, that it felt as if he had been kicked in the chest by one of our Belgian horses (large drafts weighing over one ton.) Had excruciating back pain, numb big toe, was dizzy, and saw stars. You saw that, didn’t you, and heard her say that?
A. Yes.
Q. And that was consistent with sudden onset of chest pain; isn’t it?
A. It’s the way to describe the severity of the pain. Q, Also, if he felt like he was kicked, and so, when you’re kicked, you have a sudden onset of pain, right’?
A. It would go along as a substitute. When people come in with chest pain, they can also describe it as an elephant sitting on their chest, or a ton of bricks on their chest.
Q. That was not the description. The description was: He felt as if he had been kicked. So, assume for a moment that this is consistent with the sudden onset of chest pain, okay?
A. Okay.
Q. When Mr. Epperly came into the emergency room, he didn’t know what tests he needed; did he?
A. No.
Q. He didn’t know that he needed another EKG?
A. No.
Q. That was your decision?
A. Correct.
Q. He didn’t know that he needed a blood test?
A. Correct.
Q. That was your decision?
A. Yes.
Q. He didn’t know what to test in the blood? He didn’t know that the enzymes needed to be tested, right?
A. I would assume so.
Q. That was your decision?
A. Yes.
Q. If the enzyme had been positive, it would have shown that he was in the process of having a heart attack, right?
A. Correct.

[The examiner returns to the core issue of whose job it is to ask the questions that elicit the key history.]
Q. SO, when you’re going through and determining whether his presentation is consistent with a heart attack, you were the one who knows what information is critical to determine what is consistent and what is inconsistent, right?
A. I’m the one that takes the history, yes.
Q. Not just takes the history, but orders the tests?
A. Correct.
Q. SO, you have no reason to believe that John Epperly had any medical knowledge of what was important or unimportant in evaluating either his heart or his aorta; true?
A. True.
Q. And so, isn’t it true, Doctor, that if the turning point of this whole case, the turning point of whether to do a CT Scan, is whether this is sudden, that it was your responsibility, your duty, to ask the question; isn’t that true?
A. Yes, again, I do not blame Mr. Epperly for that.
Q. Just like it was your duty, your responsibility to order the troponin, and if you had not ordered the troponin, if you were to come to court, and this was a heart attack case, and you said that his history was not consistent, because he didn’t have a positive troponin, but I didn’t order it, that would be substandard care; wouldn’t it?
A. If you did not order the troponin, and you were suspicious of a heart attack, yes.
Q. Just like in this case, by not asking Mr. Epperly whether this was sudden, and you have no reason to believe that he wouldn’t have told you that it was sudden, right? I think that probably, if this is the history, he’s walking down the street, and he has a sudden onset of chest pain, if you would have asked him, he would have said it was sudden, true?

[More relentless questioning further undermines the defense of “not sudden.”]
A. He might have, yes.
Q. Probably would have. There is no reason to hold that back. He’s in there, he’s letting you stick holes in his arm, take x-rays, he’s letting you hook him up to EKG; if you asked him a simple question, and said: Was this sudden? He probably would have told you that it was sudden.
A. The chances are good, yes.
Q. So, isn’t it true, doctor, and don’t you admit to this jury, by not asking the question, by not finding out that this was sudden — which is a life or death question in this case — that care was substandard? Don’t you really admit that, sir?
A. By not asking the question, it did not warrant the CT Scan, so, yes, it did affect the outcome.

[The witness makes one admission but not the core one of substandard care, so the questioner returns.]
Q. Don’t you admit, because you didn’t ask the question, and because your whole decision on whether to do this CT was based upon that question, don’t you really admit, that in this case, that since that question was so important, and because the answer was likely going to be, it was sudden, that that reflects substandard care on your part; isn’t that true?
A. It reflect a substandard in the history taking.
Q. Is it the history that, in your mind —
A. Right.
Q. — is so important, about whether or not to do the CT. So, had you asked the question as you now admit that you were required to do, and you probably would have gotten the answer that it was sudden, it was substandard care, and cost this man his life; true?
A. Not having the sudden onset in the history affected the outcome with regard to ordering or not ordering a CT; and ultimately, yes, the death of Mr. Epperly.
Q. So, you agree with me, that your failure to ask the question, cost Mr. Epperly his life, and that was substandard care?
A. The failure of not asking him the question did affect the result on whether or not to order a CT, which then affected his life, yes.
Q. And that was substandard care, true?
A. Yes. MR. LEVENTHAL: No further questions.
Q. Do you admit then, if in fact Mr. Epperly told you, in addition to the fact that it started that morning — do you admit to this jury, if he told you that, your care was substandard?
A. My care would have been modified to include a CT in the work-up, if I would have gotten the sudden component of the chest pain.
Q. My question is, sir, if in fact you did get that information, if in fact Mr. Epperly said exactly what he told Rana, when she said that she heard, when she was in the emergency room, it came on while he was walking, felt like a — like his Belgian stepped on his chest. If he told you that and you didn’t do a CT, do you admit to this jury, that your care was substandard?
A. If it was sudden, and I did not do a CT, a CT should have been included in the work up.
Q. So you admit it?
A. From a sudden standpoint?
Q. Yes.
A. It should have been included in the work up.

Q. So, when you, given your admission, and given your statement in the deposition, that the standard of care is to rule it out so that they don’t die while you’re thinking it is something else, and you didn’t do that, you admit to the jury that your care, because there was a chance that this man was having an aortic dissection, given his presentation, that because you didn’t rule it out, don’t you admit that your care was substandard, truthfully?
A. In my heart, I still believe that the care provided for Mr. Epperly was appropriate.
Q. So, isn’t it true, doctor, and don’t you admit to this jury, by not asking the question, by not finding out that this was sudden — which is a life or death question in this case — that care was substandard? Don’t you really admit that, sir?
A. By not asking the question, it did not warrant the CT Scan, so, yes, it did affect the outcome.
Q. Don’t you admit, because you didn’t ask the question, and because your whole decision on whether to do this CT was based upon that question, don’t you really admit, that in this case, that since that question was so important, and because the answer was likely going to be, it was sudden, that that reflects substandard care on your part; isn’t that true?
A. It reflect a substandard in the history taking.
Q. Is it the history that, in your mind —
A. Right.
Q. — is so important, about whether or not to do the CT. So, had you asked the question as you now admit that you were required to do, and you probably would have gotten the answer that it was sudden, it was substandard care, and cost this man his life; true?
A. Not having the sudden onset in the history affected the outcome with regard to ordering or not ordering a CT; and ultimately, yes, the death of Mr. Epperly.
Q. So, you agree with me, that your failure to ask the question, cost Mr. Epperly his life, and that was substandard care?
A. The failure of not asking him the question did affect the result on whether or not to order a CT, which then affected his life, yes.
Q. And that was substandard care, true?
A. Yes.
###

[A brilliant close to a brilliant cross. Leventhal chose his words extremely carefully, and ended up describing the event so persuasively that he seems to have convinced even the witness that his care was substandard. After this, the witness’s lawyer made a game attempt on redirect at reviving the witness, but the corpse was cold.]

Closing Comments by Malone:
“Was Your Care Substandard?” A Reprise
Let’s do an instant replay of all the questions that directly asked the witness if his care was “substandard.”
First try:
Q. Do you admit then, if in fact Mr. Epperly told you, in addition to the fact that it started that morning — do you admit to this jury, if he told you that, your care was substandard?
A. My care would have been modified to include a CT in the work-up, if I would have gotten the sudden component of the chest pain.
Second try, one question later:
Q. My question is, sir, if in fact you did get that information, if in fact Mr. Epperly said exactly what he told Rana, when she said that she heard, when she was in the emergency room, it came on while he was walking, felt like a — like his Belgian stepped on his chest. If he told you that and you didn’t do a CT, do you admit to this jury, that your care was substandard?
A. If it was sudden, and I did not do a CT, a CT should have been included in the work up.
Q. So you admit it?
A. From a sudden standpoint?
Q. Yes.
A. It should have been included in the work up.
[That was pretty close to what the examiner was looking for, but the series of answers had so many qualifiers that it didn’t feel like a clean admission.]
Third try (and the witness has revived his fight):
Q. So, when you, given your admission, and given your statement in the deposition, that the standard of care is to rule it out so that they don’t die while you’re thinking it is something else, and you didn’t do that, you admit to the jury that your care, because there was a chance that this man was having an aortic dissection, given his presentation, that because you didn’t rule it out, don’t you admit that your care was substandard, truthfully?
A. In my heart, I still believe that the care provided for Mr. Epperly was appropriate.
[These next questions comprise a single stretch of examination that ended the questioning, but let’s break it up into discrete times when the “substandard” question is asked.]
Fourth:
Q. So, isn’t it true, doctor, and don’t you admit to this jury, by not asking the question, by not finding out that this was sudden — which is a life or death question in this case — that care was substandard? Don’t you really admit that, sir?
A. By not asking the question, it did not warrant the CT Scan, so, yes, it did affect the outcome.
Fifth:
Q. Don’t you admit, because you didn’t ask the question, and because your whole decision on whether to do this CT was based upon that question, don’t you really admit, that in this case, that since that question was so important, and because the answer was likely going to be, it was sudden, that that reflects substandard care on your part; isn’t that true?
A. It reflect a substandard in the history taking.
[The witness has now admitted “substandard” on one aspect of his work.]
Sixth:
Q. Is it the history that, in your mind —
A. Right.
Q. — is so important, about whether or not to do the CT. So, had you asked the question as you now admit that you were required to do, and you probably would have gotten the answer that it was sudden, it was substandard care, and cost this man his life; true?
A. Not having the sudden onset in the history affected the outcome with regard to ordering or not ordering a CT; and ultimately, yes, the death of Mr. Epperly.
[The witness again retreats from the “substandard” admission, admitting causation but not directly answering the substandard question. So:
Seventh:
Q. So, you agree with me, that your failure to ask the question, cost Mr. Epperly his life, and that was substandard care?
A. The failure of not asking him the question did affect the result on whether or not to order a CT, which then affected his life, yes.
Eighth:
Q. And that was substandard care, true?
A. Yes.
In this last stretch, the witness admitted three times that not asking the right question in his examination of the patient had, as Leventhal put it, “cost Mr. Epperly his life,” but avoided answering whether the care was substandard. Finally, he gave it up. How many questioners would have persisted this long? Most would have retreated long before the end, thinking that the early admissions were “close enough.” As the old sayin
Q Good morning, sir. My name is Patrick Malone.

A  I’m sorry, I didn’t catch your last name.

Q Patrick Malone. Doctor Lewinski, is police psychology recognized by the American Psychological Associated as a branch of psychology?

A  No, they are groups of police psychologists, but there’s no recognized branch. APA has a branch of police psychology.

Q But it’s not recognized as one of the traditional — well, let’s back up for a second. You’ve got educational psychology; right?

A  That’s correct.

Q You’re not an educational psychologist.

A  That’s correct.

Q Educational psychology requires a license in most states; right?

A  To practice in a school, yes, it does.

Q And by the way, are you licensed anywhere in to practice any kind of psychology?

A  The only license accorded in Minnesota is clinical psychology and educational psychology, and I’m not. I teach in the university.

Q You’re not licensed to practice psychology in Minnesota of either clinical or educational. Is that what you just told us?

A  That’s correct.

Q And you’re not licensed in any of the other forty-nine states to practice any kind of psychology. Is that right?

A  I don’t do diagnosis and therapy, that’s correct, which are the license issues, diagnosis and therapy.

Q Now, have you ever taken exam to be licensed in any branch of psychology?

A  No, I grandfathered in when I was a clinical psychologist. I grandfathered in under the supervision of a licensed psychologist so I could call myself a psychologist, but I did not take an exam.

Q So, when you say that you’re not licensed to do diagnosis and treatment, that means that you are not qualified to diagnose whether someone is suffering from a psychological disorder. Correct?

MR. CREECH: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: In a clinical term, that is correct.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q Okay. How, nonetheless, do you feel that you’re an objective behavioral scientist?

A  I study and understand the research, and apply it as I believe it should be applied.

Q Do you accept the word “objective”?

A  Yes, I do.

Q And you are one?

A  I believe I am objective.

Q You apply objective techniques?

A  In what circumstance, sir?

Q  Well, in the circumstance when you’re coming into court to testify in a case, have you applied objective recognized techniques?

A  Yes. You mean empirically neutral?

Q  Yes.

A  Yes.

Q  So, you come in as a neutral person, not taking sides when you start out the case. Is that right?

A  That’s correct. I evaluate and pick up a case based entirely on the merit of that case as I view it, whether or not I have something to say based on what I know about the scientific literature.

[This might have been a good time for me to challenge the witness’s claim of objectivity by pointing out that he was always hired by police departments and always testified for the officer, never by the civilian challenging the officer’s conduct. This veers into the witness’s bias, which strictly speaking isn’t part of qualifications, so I postponed it, but the line between credentials and bias is gray enough that I probably should have ventured at least a question or two into his testimonial pattern.]

Q  All right. Now, would you agree that an objective scientist follows a principle we could call transparency?

A  What do you mean by “transparency”?

Q  Transparency means that you do your work in such a way that people can look over your shoulder and conduct peer review and see if you have done it in an objectively neutral way. True?

A  To the extent that I presented research in that form, yes, that is true. But I tend not to publish in the areas, I only present material, primarily present material that has been researched by others. I do some specific research on my own that I have presented in peer review conferences, but not peer-reviewed publications.

Q  When you do research, you try to save your data so that other people can review it. That’s called peer review; right?

A  That’s correct.

Q  Okay. And you do that you follow that.

A  To the extent that we present it in peer review conferences, yes, we have.

Q  Now, you’re familiar with Calibre Press?

A  Yes, I used to work with them. No longer do, but I used to work in conjunction with them.

Q  Well, don’t they have a stable of expert witnesses that you’re a part of?

A  Well, at one point they asked me to be part of a group of expert witnesses, and I think I did a case of two with them back in the eighties, but I no longer have any association with them.

Q  We checked the Calibre Press web site on December 28, 2005, and you’re listed as being in their stable of experts available to defend police in cases like this. Did you know what?

MR. CREECH: Objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q  Let me show it to you.

THE COURT: No, just ask him the question. You don’t have to show it.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q  Do you see your picture there on that page, sir?

A  Yes, I see that.

Q  That’s Bill Lewinski.

A  That’s correct.

Q  Do you see the date in the corner, December 28, 2005?

A  I am not responsible for what they don’t take off their web site. I’m sorry. They’ve changed hands many times, and I have had no connection with them in any legal encounter in any case since maybe, I don’t know, ’92, ’95.

Q  Well, wait a second, one of the things that they had put out —

MR. CREECH: Your Honor —

BY MR. MALONE:

Q  — is something called —

THE COURT:  Yes. Just a minute.

MR. CREECH: I’ll wait until he asks it.

THE COURT: Thank you.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q  — put out something called the Calibre Press Street Survival Newsline.

A  That’s correct.

MR. CREECH: Your Honor, I’m going to object as to what somebody else does.

MALONE: I can tie it right in.

MR. CREECH: Your Honor —

THE COURT: Wait a minute. I’m going to sustain his objection. He says he hasn’t been on the site since ’92, ’95. Ask him something else.

MALONE: I’m trying to impeach that, Your Honor. I have some evidence of that.

THE COURT: What?

BY MR. MALONE:

Q  Calibre Press has a Street Survival Newsline that you are still part of.

A  They may still be presenting my research saying they did present some of my research back in the nineties, but I have had no association with them since they shifted to prime media, and I don’t remember when that was. They may still publish some of the newslines containing my information. My understanding is that they’re doing that. They’re going back and repeating old newslines, but they’ve never informed me, nor do I know anything about this.

Q  It’s a freely available website that you can check right now. Right?

MR. CREECH: Your Honor, I object.

THE COURT: Overruled.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q  True?

A  I suppose I could. I have no interest in it.

Q They say that Doctor Lewinski, a highly successful member of the Calibre Press expert witness team, may be able to assist your attorney, and that’s the policeman officer’s attorney, in strategizing your case. Do you deny that you had any role in putting that on their web site?

MR. CREECH: Objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  [Overruled.]

A  Initially, when Chuck Remsburg worked at that and he was in charge of Calibre Press, we did not look at how behavioral science could help an officer be able to explain to a court what happened.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q  And that includes working with the defense lawyer to strategize the case?

A  Certainly the presentation of behavioral science is part of the presentation. For instance, we just looked at some of the very sophisticated, I think, psychologically sophisticated material, and how is that introduced, and how does that explain what an officer did as part of the strategy. So, to the extent that people would ask me about that and I would explain that, then, that would be part of the strategy. And Chuck Remsburg, when he owned that, I worked openly with him in that. But I have not had any connection with them since he sold that company, and that’s been —

Q  Do you ever obtain expert witness consultations through a lady named Slavka Chrenkova, who is the Sales Manager at Calibre Press?

A  She’s left messages on my machine and I do not return them. I am not interested in working with Calibre Press.

Q  And why is that? Because they are biased?

MR. CREECH: Objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained. I’m going to let you do voir dire, but what you’re doing is cross-examining him on other issues. Let’s keep with the voir dire. I want to know whether or not I should qualify him as a behavioral scientist with a specialty in police psychology. That’s all that’s in front of me here.

MALONE: Okay.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q  Let’s talk about what you did in this case for objective testing that an objective scientist would do.

MR. CREECH: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  no, I did not.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q  In fact, you’re not qualified to administer objective psychological tests.

A  Clinical psychological tests, that is true. I can’t tell you whether he’s paranoid, or depressive, schizophrenia, I can’t tell you. I can’t tell you whether he has a disorder, I cannot do that.

Q  You’re familiar with the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory; right?

A  The MMPI, yes, I am.

Q  And the MMPI is universally recognized as a valid psychological tool when you’re trying to diagnose whether someone is suffering from a certain condition?

A  Yes. And I have studied and consulted with people that developed that test. I’m very familiar with that test.

Q  But you are not qualified to give the test, or interpret the test.

A  Only clinical licensed psychologists can give that test in the State. Professors cannot unless we receive a clinical license.

Q  Now, did you ever consider in this case hiring a clinical psychologist to work with you to do an examination of Carlton Jones who would give objective data?

MR. CREECH: Objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Yes. I don’t think we’re getting to the issue. I’m going to admit him and let you cross-examine him. I don’t know what he’s going to say about Carlton Jones.

MR MALONE:  I’ve got a lot more material on his qualifications, Your Honor.

THE COURT: But you’re not doing voir dire, Mr. Malone. I’m not going to get into an argument with you like I did yesterday.

MR. MALONE: I don’t want to do that either.

THE COURT: But I’ll tell you, this is voir dire. It’s very general admission that they’re looking for. I don’t know where this is going to go. I have no idea. But when they get into the specifics, then all your questions may be totally relevant. Or we may not even get to your questions, because on Direct I might not let him testify, based on whatever this general admission is. And I don’t know what it means yet. So, he may be admitted as an expert in his field, but it may not have anything to do with this case as far as I’m concerned right now.MALONE: Well, can we just reserve then on his —

THE COURT: Absolutely. I don’t know how else to handle it because it’s such a board category that they’re qualifying him in. But I’m not sure that it means anything for this case. So, let’s just see where it goes.

LATTIMER: Your Honor, before we do that, he has indicated what he was going to testify as an expert in this case previously

THE COURT:  In the report?

LATTIMER: And that is inconsistent with what he’s saying today. And that’s what I would like to approach him on.

THE COURT: Well, when he gets to that, we might. They may abandon some of that in the report. I don’t know what he’s going to be offered for.

LATTIMER: All right. When he gets to the point of offering, then I will bring it up.

THE COURT: Certainly. Go ahead, Mr. Creech.

MR. CREECH: Thank you, Your Honor.

[THEREUPON, Direct Examination not requested to be transcribed.]

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. MALONE:

Q Good afternoon again.

A  Good afternoon.

Q  In terms of what you did in this case, sir, to bring down the generalities into something specifically relevant for this case, you didn’t go out to the scene to see what the scene looked like. Is that true?

A That is correct.

Q  You did a telephone interview of Carlton Jones?

A  That is correct, that was one of them.

Q  You didn’t try to do any kind of real diagnostic examination of Mr. Jones; correct?

A [not transcribed]

Q  You didn’t examine the Montero that he was driving to see how complicated the gearshift was. True?

A  True. I did not.

Q  You did not examine the seatbelt mechanism to see how complicated the seatbelt mechanism was?

A  No. I made certain assumptions about how complicated it was, but I did not look specifically at a Montero.

[These last questions about the car’s gearshift and its seatbelt went to Carlton Jones’s claim that he felt no choice but to fire his weapon multiple times at Prince Jones’s vehicle rather than drive away or undo his seatbelt and get out of the car.]

Q  You say you may have looked at a few of the photos of the scene?

A  I remember seeing something about the damage to the vehicle in the early phases of my preparation for my report, but I don’t remember that. It may have been just a description of the damage to the vehicle.

Q  So, you may not have even seen any photos.

A That’s correct.

Q  Okay. So you didn’t try to do any kind of forensic analysis of this case?

A I did no forensic analysis or forensic reconstruction on this case.

[This next line of questions sets up a return to the line of questions I had started in the qualifications phase on the theme that objective scientists are transparent by recording what they do so others can do peer review.]

Q  Now, did you record this interview you did at [of] Carlton Jones?

A  No, I did not.

Q Did you take notes on the interview?

A No, I was looking solely for — I was trying to assess his perception of “threat,” and that’s the prime thing. The whole hour was focused on building a relationship and just trying to take him step‑by‑step through the incident to see whether or not his perception was consistent with what I would term a perception of threat.

Q  You took some notes, I take it, during this process?

A No, I don’t believe I did.

Q  Or even afterwards, you didn’t take any notes?

A No. It was an impression I was looking for.

Q  Is that scientific?

A To the extent that I was asked to comment on whether or not his behavior was consistent with someone who had been in that condition, then all I had to do is get his statements. I am not polygraph person, nor was I doing a clinical assessment on him.

Q  But for an objection [objective] scientist to follow this principle we call transparency, so that people can look over your shoulder and see if what your assessment of him was accurate, it would be important to either record it, or take some notes, or do something. True?

A I did record it in my report.

Q  Well, what you recorded was one line that said you had an one‑hour interview with the gentleman.

A And I certainly used it as a foundation for my opinion in the case, including that he saw this as a position of threat.

Q  But you didn’t save any notes that would allow us to review and possibly even cross-examine you on that?

A No, I did not write down that Officer Jones saw this as a position of threat, which is what I was primarily driving toward in the interview.

Q Now, you say you worked for an hour with him to establish a relationship with him, in part.

A  Yes, just asking him some general questions.

Q Now, is that part of the standard practice of a clinical psychologist?

MR. CREECH: Objection, Your Honor. He’s not qualified as an expert in —

THE COURT: Sustained.

BY MR. MALONE:

[I adjusted the question quickly to respond to the sustained objection. This actually made it better.]

Q  Well, is that the standard practice of any kind of psychologist?

A Yes. If I’m going to do an interview, it’s a standard practice with an interviewer to ask any questions dealing with personal material as part of an interviewing strategy. You don’t have to be a psychologist to do interviewing.

Q So, you were doing an interview just like any newspaper reporter would do an interview. True?

A Or an attorney, trying to build some relationship, and then trying to get somebody to report on what they saw. I had — at that point, I had depositions — I believe I had depositions — I had reports, and, therefore, I was looking to see, was this — was what he was going to tell me consistent with what was in the reports.

[What I might have done better here would have been to follow up on the witness’s volunteering that he saw his relationship with the subject as more like an attorney developing a relationship with a client rather than like a true scientist. Instead I went back to the theme of his failure to record anything about the interview, and was shut down because it was repetitive.]

Q  And, of course, it would be helpful to know whether what he told you was consistent with the recorded statements, if you had written something about what he had told you?

MR. CREECH: Objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Basis.

MR. CREECH: I think we’ve been over this.

THE COURT: I think so. I agree.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q  Now, in the field of psychology and psychiatry, this issue you call perceptual blockage, there is a diagnosis of someone who has amnesia for a specific short period of time. True?

A  I understand there is.

Q  And there’s a specific diagnosis. It’s called dissociative amnesia. True?

A  I believe that to be true, and it’s part of what we’re assessing in the studies. I have not done the studies, but it’s part of what is assessed by psychologists who study it. Dissociation is certainly one of the things we’re looking for with people who have high stress in certain situations.

Q To determine if an individual has dissociative amnesia, you’ve got to follow the rules for figuring that out; don’t you?

MR. CREECH: Objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Basis?

MR. CREECH: Your Honor, he’s not testified he made such a determination.

THE COURT:  I though he just said it’s part of the mix that he — I might have gotten that wrong, but I just thought he said it was part of the mix that he does consider. You can clarify that, but that’s what I though he said. So, therefore, I overrule the objection.

THE WITNESS:  The question?

BY MR. MALONE:

Q The question was — well, let me back up. There are criteria that are set out by the American Psychiatric Association for making a diagnosis of dissociative amnesia. True?

A That is correct, there certainly are, and it’s a standard clinical diagnosis.

Q And it comes from this book here, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition.

A Also, I think it’s in the Third Edition, too.

Q  This is the Bible of psychiatric and psychological diagnoses, this book here.

A This is correct.

Q  Okay. Now, did you follow any of the criterial set out in this book for reaching a determination that a person has dissociative amnesia?

A I was not asked to do a clinical diagnosis, nor am I qualified to do that. I was asked, is a dissociative state temporary, very temporary dissociative state, as what was reported here, is it consistent with trauma, and with distortions. And the answer to that is, yes, it is. And the officer —

Q Well, being consistent is that – it means that it can also be inconsistent. Right?

A Would you please explain?

Q Well, just because something is consistent with high stress doesn’t necessarily mean that to a reasonable degree of professional certainty the person — that is what happened to the person; right?

A Yes. And I was not asked to determine that.

Q Okay. So you’re not giving any opinions — let’s just get this straight — you’re not giving any opinions about whether Corporal Jones has dissociative amnesia or any other kind of loss of memory related to this stress. True?

A That would be a clinical diagnosis versus a reporting of symptoms and comparison with high stress performance, which is a well‑documented phenomenon. Those two align. That’s all I’m saying. I’m not saying he was clinically diagnosable. I’m not saying that.

Q You know that one of the things that they have to rule out when they’re trying to find out if someone has a memory loss that is genuine, or is not genuine, is whether or not there is some element of the malingering by that person. True?

MR. CREECH: Objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Look, the only reason why I’m allowing this is because he said this is one of the things that he looked into. That’s what I remember his testimony. So, if he looked into it, it’s just fair cross-examination. If he didn’t look into it, then I would certainly sustain your objection. But right now I have to overrule it because he put it into play. Let’s go, Mr. Malone.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q  Let me read you a quote from the DSM. “Malingered amnesia is most common in individuals presenting with acute, florid symptoms in a context in which potential secondary gain is evident — for example, financial or legal problems or the desire to avoid combat, although true amnesia may also be associated with such stressors.” Now, you don’t have any reason to dispute the official Bible of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual on that point, do you, sir?

MR. CREECH: Your Honor, I’m going to object. He just read a section out of it and —

THE COURT: Well, if he understands the question, I’ll let him answer it.

THE WITNESS:  In essence, the cusp is, is he telling the truth or not telling the truth. And I have no way of determining that, and I think that is what that is saying. You have to determine whether or not someone has an interest in lying. And to the extent that you believe Corporal Jones or you don’t believe him is the essence as to whether or not you believe he doesn’t remember, or he’s lying about it. That’s the fundamental issue.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q And you have no opinion on that?

A What he’s saying is —

Q You have no professional opinion on that?

A Correct.

Q Okay. I just want to make sure. They say, “Individuals with true dissociative amnesia usually score high on standard measures of hypnotizability and dissociative capacity.” None of those tests were ever done here. True?

A No, I did not test him, nor did I give him an MMPI. Neither of those would indicate whether or not he’s lying, by the way.

Q Now, on the business about not being able to do the complex tasks — on, actually, let me just touch on another area. You mentioned in your Direct Examination, you were asked if you’d ever been rejected by a court to give testimony. And do you remember that you said “not in person”?

A Well, that was a general statement, yes.

Q But what about — you left one of your cases off your resume. I’m a little curious about it. It’s the case of McKinney versus Duplain.

A I don’t remember that case.

Q It was just last year. You testified in the case in Timothy McKinney, individually and as personal representative of the estate of Michael McKinney, deceased, versus Robert Duplain, Jean Burton in her individual and official capacity, in the United States District Court, Southern District of India [Indiana]. That doesn’t ring a bell?

A (Pause.)

Q You gave ballistic opinions and trajectory opinions in that case.

A I believe that case is still in the works. I submitted — if I recall, that’s a case involving Falls State University.

Q Is that correct?

A  Yes, I did prepare a report on that. I was not deposed on that. And I don’t enter a case unless I do something with an attorney. I was consulted on the case and I did ballistic’s analysis on that.

Q  You submitted an Affidavit to the Federal Court.

A  That’s correct.

Q  And isn’t that doing something with an attorney?

A Yes. And I did prepare a ballistics report.

Q  And the Court rejected your opinion because you’re not a ballistics expert. Right?

A That’s news to me. I don’t know that.

Q Well, you’re not a ballistics expert, but you prepared a ballistics report?

A What I did was, I prepared a report based on my research of – and I’ve got extensive research in this area about action-reaction perimeters, how people turn, how they fall through a plain of fire. I’ve assisted in writing on different op si motions and subject motions, and that leads me to be able to understand the relationship between movement and bullets. I’m not a ballistic expert in the point that I know what bodies do when they’re engaged in a gunfight, and that’s my research.

Q Your opinion contradicted the pathologist who did the autopsy in the case. Don’t you remember that?

A Yes, it did.

MR. MALONE: I think that’s all I have right now.

[My co-counsel Terry Roberts said later that Lewinski “slinked out of the courtroom like a snake looking for a hole.” I’m not sure I get that much credit, but I do think the basic strategy of this cross was successful. Rather than argue with the witness about the merits of his opinions, I tried to show that he was not qualified to do what a real psychologist would have done to reach a diagnosis of Carlton Jones, and because of that, his opinions based on his unrecorded interview with the police officer weren’t worth much. We went on to win a good verdict for Prince Jones’s daughter. Check out my closing argument on damages on behalf of Nina Jones, here.]

Q. Sir, you agree that your job is to be objective?

A. That is correct, yes.

Q. You are not, it wouldn’t be appropriate for you to cherry pick certain little pieces of evidence from the record and ignore other things that just inconveniently don’t fit with your opinion. Right?

A. No, I don’t think I have done that in this review, no.

Q. It wouldn’t be right, would it?

A. It wouldn’t be right, no, sir.

Q. It wouldn’t be right to misread things in the record and draw inappropriate conclusions from them, would it?

A. That’s correct.

Q. Let’s start with the MRI business. Actually let me start first with this: We’ve got a stack, where is the other, we’ve got a stack of the University of Virginia records for the first two months of this baby’s life. You went through all of them?

A. I believe I did.

Q. And they were important to you in forming your opinions?

A. Yes, they were.

Q. So you pretty much relied on all of them to a greater or lesser extent.

A. Yes. I would say I probably relied more on the prenatal and the records that immediately surrounded the delivery of the baby, but I certainly did review the records from the University of Virginia, yes.

Q. And relied on them as well?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. So the opinion about the MRI, now, let me ask you preliminarily, is that your deposition that I see in front of you?

A. I believe it is a deposition from August 31st, 2009.

Q. Okay. So you’ve looked at it recently?

A. Yes.

Q. To prepare for today?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. Did you see any errors in there?

A. I think there were a couple of errors, yes.

Q. Kind of embarrassing ones, weren’t they?

A. Well, no. I recognize them as errors and no one is perfect.

Q. Okay. Well, one error is that you are totally changing your opinion on the MRI. True?

A. It may be. I may not have had access to some of the depositions and some of the records that I reviewed after this deposition.

Q. Well, sir, in your deposition you told us, let me show you what you said.

A. What page are you referring to?

Q. I will get there in one second, 53. Question and answer, “What is it about the report of the scan that causes you to think this was consistent with an infarct rather than an hypoxic ischemic event?” Here is your answer. By the way, today you are saying yes, it is an hypoxic ischemic event. Correct?

A. Yes.

Q. At the deposition completely the opposite. Right?

A. But I think, can I just say —

Q. Let’s just finish, this. Okay?

A. Sure.

Q. Answer, “Well, I think it was the description of the MRI being in the parietal occipital area. And again, in my experience as a neonatologist, if there had been an asphyxial event prior to delivery and in the hours prior to delivery, there would be more of a global insult rather than a discrete insult in the parietal occipital area. In my experience in the severely asphyxiated baby, for whatever reason, the hypoxic ischemic damage is all over the brain rather than confined to one particular area, as it is in this case in the parietal occipital area.”

Question: “Is that an opinion that this is more consistent with an infarct than an hypoxic ischemic event an opinion that you hold to a reasonable degree of medical probability?”

“Yes, it is.”

Question: “And it is based simply on reading the report of the radiologist?”

Answer: “That is correct.” So you are not even competent to read MRI images?

A. Oh, I admitted that for sure.

Q. Okay. The jury yesterday saw MRI images that showed damage all over this baby’s brain. You are aware of that?

A. Yes.

Q. Did Mr. Peake tell you that?

A. Yes, he did.

Q. So he told you, now we have got to move off of that opinion about there being focal injury.

MR. PEAKE: Excuse me.

MR. MALONE: I’ll restate it.

MR. PEAKE: Your Honor, I think it must be clear, I didn’t tell him.

THE COURT: He knows what is going on.

BY MR. MALONE

Q. You realize that there is absolutely no support now. And in fact, it is a little embarrassing for you to stick with what you said before about a focal injury to this baby rather than a global injury consistent with loss of oxygen due to loss of blood. True?

A. Let me qualify my opinion, if I can. I think when I gave this deposition four years ago, I didn’t have access to all of the reports and all of the depositions.

Q. You had all of these.

A. I am not too sure. Are those all of the depositions?

Q. No. I am talking about the University of Virginia records.

A. Well, I may have had those, but I think in retrospect, and I misread when he said a discrete area in the parietal, occipitoparietal area. I thought that report referred to an infarct which was not so global in nature.

Q. You just misread the report.

A. Well, I may have misread it, but certainly in rereading it, I think —

Q. Within the University of Virginia records, if you had looked at them carefully, you could have seen that the pediatric neurologists who were taking care of this baby all saw that this was an injury on the MRI that looked like oxygen deprivation from low blood flow. Didn’t you see that, sir?

A. Yes.

Q. Well, did you see that before you formed this opinion that that was wrong?

A. You know, I don’t recall.

Q. Let me show you what I am talking about here. Way too many pieces of paper here. University of Virginia, page 249, neuro consult after the MRI. All of these records were available to you a long time ago, before you gave your deposition. MRI with bilateral, BL. Posterior medial infarcts, extensive. Probably, two zeros means secondary to or caused by, right?

A. That’s correct.

Q. Probably caused by anoxia low flow. That is low blood flow. Right?

A. That’s correct.

Q. And so when you are changing your opinion today about this MRI report, and it is solely on your reading of this report which you’ve already admitted that you messed up once, now you are telling us that somewhere in this report it tells us the timing of the injury conveniently was before the amniocentesis. That’s what you are trying to say.

A. I think there is evidence that it was before. I think other experts have said it was before the amniocentesis.

Q. You are not allowed to talk about what other experts say. You know that. You know the rules of court. You have been around this track many times. But let me ask you this, though. Did you happen to read Dr. Zimmerman, the defense neuroradiologist?

A. I believe I did, yes.

Q. He said there was a range of time. You don’t remember that?

MR. PEAKE: I object, Your Honor. I don’t think he can get into something that is not in evidence at this point. Dr. Zimmerman has not testified in this case.

MR. MALONE: He said he read depositions and he is relying on them.

THE COURT: Side bar.

MR. MALONE: I can drop it. Let’s go with this MRI thing.

BY MR. MALONE:
Q. So in your deposition, you gave us no opinion about the timing of this injury based on this MRI report. True?

A. I don’t think I was asked.

Q. Sir, you were asked the basis of your opinions while you thought that this baby had some injury that preceded the amniocentesis, weren’t you?

A. My understanding of the reading of these MRIs is that you cannot be so precise as to time it within a matter of hours and it is usually a time period of several days where you may be able to predict when it happened.

Q. Sure. And the timing here is it could have been November 5th from the MRI because it is imprecise. True?

A. And it could have been November 2nd or 3rd as well.

Q. Okay. But if it could have been November 5th and it could have been November 2nd, then it doesn’t matter, does it?

A. It does matter to me because it is consistent with either the 2nd or 5th. I think the other evidence would indicate that it occurred closer to the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th rather than the 5th.

Q. We will get to that. But at least with the MRI you got to admit it is a tie ball game.

A. I think the MRI would be consistent with an injury that happened on the 5th, but maybe just as consistent with an injury that happened on the 2nd, 3rd or 4th.

Q. Show me where in this MRI report it says anything about the timing of the injury.

A. I don’t think it says anything about timing of the injury. It is just based on —

Q. But something you made up?

A. Not something I made up. But I think in reading the literature of MRI reports in this particular kind of circumstance, I think the evidence would indicate that you cannot time it precisely, that there is a window of days not hours where you can time the onset of the injury.
Q. Didn’t you try to tell this jury on direction examination that this MRI supported the opinion that the injury occurred before the amniocentesis?

A. I think I did. I think it does support it.

Q. Now you are saying it could maybe not support it.

A. I said taken in context with all of the other evidence it does, in fact, support that the injury, I can’t disallow or ignore the other evidence in the case of the dark blood on the second pass of the amniocentesis, the baby’s Apgars and everything else.

Q. Let’s stick with one thing at a time. Okay? Now, let’s talk about cherry picking. On the newborn record, and you told us about, you know, mild to moderate resuscitation. You left out one thing, didn’t you? What was this baby’s oxygen saturation on room air after she had had half an hour of oxygen and after she had had the bag valve mask?

A. I don’t recall her being in room air a half-hour after the resuscitation. You would have to show me the record. I thought she had a saturation of around 45 percent, but I thought at that time she may have been in some oxygen.

Q. Well, the jury heard yesterday from the nursery nurse that they removed the baby just quickly from oxygen to see what her saturation would be on room air; and that’s appropriate. Right?

A. Yes.

Q. Just quickly.

A. Yes.

Q. And in fact, it was at 7:45 p.m. it was 37 to 45 percent saturation. Correct?

A. Correct.

Q. If she had stayed on room air, she would have died.

A. Well, I am not so sure she would have died, but certainly we can recognize that those saturations require some therapy.

Q. Not compatible with life to have an oxygen saturation of 37 to 45 percent.

A. Well, I wouldn’t say not compatible with life. It certainly requires intervention. And I think given in this setting, too, that there may be other explanations as to why the saturations were low. I am not saying nothing to get concerned about — certainly I think they did respond appropriately to the saturation — but in patients who have poor perfusion we know that the pulse oximeter does not always read accurately. So the documentation of that may have been artificially reading low.

Q. Sheer speculation.

A. I am just saying that just, this is just a known fact. It is not speculation. It happens all the time in patients.

Q. It is sheer speculation that this baby had a 37-percent oxygen saturation only because the machine wasn’t working.

A. That is not speculation at all. It is very commonly seen in patients, particularly who are hypovolemic or who are anemic and in the immediate stabilization period.

Q. Oh, and she was hypovolemic. You left that totally out of your opinion, didn’t you?

A. Well, I don’t think anybody asked me about it, but she was hypovolemic. I didn’t mean to leave it out.

Q. Well, hypovolemic, low blood volume, they had to pump her up repeatedly. Right?

A. Well, they gave fluid boluses, yes, at least on two occasions before transfer.

Q. More than two.

A. Three occasions, yes.

Q. In fact, she couldn’t hold up her blood pressure after the first two and so that is why Dr. Stickley bolused her again.

A. That’s correct.

Q. She had a low blood pressure.

A. She did have a low blood pressure.

Q. That is not consistent with an injury two or three days earlier, is it, sir?

A. Well, it may be. It certainly may be.

Q. You are saying that a baby has failed to, and you know the concept that we all do, if we bleed and we don’t get a transfusion, our blood vessels suck up the fluid.

A. Interstitial fluid.

Q. The interstitial fluid, and restore volume.

A. They have a tendency to do that, yes.

Q. They do that within hours?

A. (Nods head.) Perhaps several hours, yes.

Q. Several hours. And by the time passage of several hours, it is usually a normal amount of volume. True?

A. Or near to normal, true. Certainly it is an attempt on the organism to reestablish a normal blood volume, yes.

Q. One of the reasons you said in your deposition that you thought the resuscitation was essentially no big deal was that you said the baby was happy after all of this. Do you remember that?

A. I think that is something I think referred to the mother in retrospect in looking at the records. It was very misleading the way it was written in the chart.

Q. Actually what you, you mentioned it twice. I am going to show you what you said.

MR. PEAKE: Well, Your Honor, first of all, he has to ask him, he hasn’t testified inconsistently. He doesn’t just get to show his deposition. There has to be some
inconsistent testimony.

BY MR. MALONE:
Q. You relied, in part, on the fact that this was a quote, happy baby, didn’t you?

A. Well, the way “happy” was written —

Q. Can you just answer the question?

A. I am going to answer it. The way happy was written —

THE COURT: Just answer it now, yes or no, did you rely on that language.

THE WITNESS: Initially I did, yes.

THE COURT: All right. You will be given an opportunity to explain. Go ahead.

MR. MALONE: May I just show him what he said so we have it in context?

THE COURT: Yes.

BY MR. MALONE:
Q. “Baby was described after the resuscitative efforts as, quote, being happy. The resuscitation was relatively uneventful. The baby only required some positive pressure ventilation for two or three minutes and some oxygen and responded very well.”
And then on another page, I won’t bother showing the jury, you referred again to the baby being happy. Right?

A. That’s correct.

Q. Okay. And here is what the record says on who was happy. This is the newborn record with the Apgars that we have looked at. There is a section in just about any newborn record on the subject of bonding. Right, sir?

A. There may be, yes.

Q. Bonding is mom and baby, dad and baby bonding together?

A. That’s correct.

Q. It is psychologically very important?

A. That’s correct.

Q. And that is why you document it. If you had a mom in there who had no interest in the baby, they might want to call Social Services or whatever, and you know, get some involvement. Right?

A. Sure, sure.

Q. So bonding here, length of time two to three minutes. Persons present, father of baby. Response to infant, happy. That is what you misread.

A. That’s correct.

Q. Okay. You said that it was important to understand the cause of a child’s injury in order to develop a treatment plan.

A. I did, yes.

Q. If there has been recent loss of volume that hasn’t yet stabilized, the doctors would be more concerned about giving fluid and then eventually maybe blood transfusions as opposed to a remote event.

A. I would say by and large that is true, yes.

Q. And in this case you have already told us that one of the things that was important to you or that you relied on was the baby’s assessment when she got to the University of Virginia. True?

A. Correct.

Q. You looked, didn’t you, for some doctor in the record who would support your opinion that this mother had had some previous bleeding in her detachment of her placenta and that that caused all of this baby’s problems. You looked, didn’t you?

A. I looked, and I think as I recall from the admission note there was a note that this baby was born to a mother that had a placenta abruption, that was their assessment as well.

Q. Yeah. Actually you totally misread that one, too. Let me show you what the admission assessment was of David Kaufman. Do you know who Dr. Kaufmann is, David Kaufman?

A. I don’t know him, no.

Q. He is a neonatologist at the University of Virginia.

A. Um-um.

Q. Let’s look at what he said.

MR. MALONE: Do you want me to approach on this, Your Honor?

THE COURT: Yes, I think so.

MR. MALONE: I would be happy to.

THE COURT: Counsel, let’s touch base for just a second. Members of the jury, are you all right?

THE JURY: Yes.

(A bench conference was had out of the presence and hearing of the jury and the court reporter.)

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. The single most important record that you would want to see to see contemporaneously what people thought at the time would be the admission assessment because down the road, you know, information gets distorted and people change what they, you have seen that before, you go back to the core source.

MR. PEAKE: I object to the form of that question. He can ask about the record and explain —

THE COURT: He is just trying to lay a foundation. Objection overruled. Restate your question.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. The admission assessment is an important piece of data. Correct?

A. It can be important, but certainly not any more important than the events that happened prior to the transfer or prior to –

Q. Let’s stay on subject now. The admission assessment, University of Virginia, the little girl has been helicoptered there after this, you know, you claim mild to moderate resuscitation event. She did need intensive care, you admit that.

A. She did subsequently, yes.

Q. And Dr. Stickley was right to send her to the University of Virginia.

A. Yes, he was.

Q. So Dr. Kaufman’s assessment, this is so early in the case that they don’t have Marissa’s name on there. That is a typical thing, you say “Baby Girl Simpson”?

A. That could be, yes.

Q. November 6th, 2001, “I have reviewed the history, discussed the perinatal history.” Perinatal means the events surrounding the birth. Right?

A. That’s correct.

Q. “And current condition of the baby with the referring physician Dr. Stickley. Arrange the neonatal transport, discuss transport management with the transport clinician. Examined the baby myself, reviewed the following tests,” and he refers to arterial blood gas. Correct?

A. That’s correct.

Q. Hematocrit, HCT?

A. Correct.

Q. Complete blood count?

A. Correct.

Q. Electrolytes?

A. That’s right.

Q. And chest x-ray. “This is a 2977 gram baby.” That is the same as 6 pounds 9 ounces. I only know that because I had a cheat sheet.

A. Yes.

Q. “2977 gram baby born 37 weeks of gestation. This is 37-week AGA infant.” That AGA means appropriate for gestational age. Right?

A. That’s correct.

Q. And that means she is not big, not small, in a good range, in an appropriate range.

A. For that gestational age, correct.

Q. “Delivered by stat C-section after complication of acute blood loss from amniocentesis when needle came in contact with placenta.” You saw that Dr. Kaufman wrote that?

A. I did.

Q. And you rejected it?

A. I did.

Q. You know more than Dr. Kaufman knew at the time?

A. That doesn’t comport with what the findings were prior to transporting. I think if you look through that UVa chart there is another admission and history physical which would indicate that this baby had a placental abruption. I don’t know who it was written by, but it was in the early days of her admission.

Q. I am going to ask you to point it out for me since it is so important to you. Do you have it?

A. I don’t have it with me. I hope Mr. Peake can find it.

Q. “At C-section amniotic fluid was noted to be grossly bloody.” You knew that. Right?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. How did that amniotic fluid get to be grossly bloody, by the way?

A. Well, I assume the needle went through the placenta. What you have to do in certain circumstances, and that there was some blood as that needle came back out, and there was probably some blood in the amniotic fluid as well.

Q. Interesting. So now you agree that the fluid was bloody in the amniotic sac because of the amniocentesis.

A. Well, I think it was both, blood from the amnio perhaps and from the old blood which was described as occurred during the second pass of the needle.

Q. How does that work?

A. Well, I think if you look at the testimony that after —

Q. I am talking anatomically. How does that work?

A. Well, the needle would go through the abdominal wall and through the placenta and into the amniotic fluid and you withdraw fluid.

Q. Right.

A. And with that fluid would be whatever is in the amniotic fluid, old blood, maybe some new blood.

Q. But how did the old blood get into an intact amniotic sac? That is my question.

A. I think you can see that with an abruption.

Q. Okay. I will get back to that in a minute. Let me finish this. So he talks about the baby’s condition, and we don’t need to go through all of that. Infant, the, what they did to revive the baby, maternal history. Here is the physical exam he is talking about, color is pale, there is good perfusion. It says the baby is still pale many hours after birth. Right?

A. According to that note, yes.

Q. Well, you don’t have anything to contradict it, do you?

A. No. I just said according to that note the baby was described, yes.

Q. He is looking for birth defects and he doesn’t see any birth defects. Right?

A. That’s correct.

Q. He writes down what the issues are and under perinatal compromise, “Mild to moderate, bloody amniotic fluid after amniocentesis with anemic child requiring fluid resuscitation for hypotension.” Right?

A. That is correct.

Q. So his gestalt on the whole case was that the child got anemia from the amnio and that is why she needed the fluid resuscitation at birth because she had low blood pressure.

MR. PEAKE: I object to that. He can’t infer from what is written here what Dr. Kaufman’s thought process was.

MR. MALONE: I am sorry we don’t need testimony from counsel on this. I can ask the witness the question.

MR. PEAKE: That is my objection, Your Honor, as it is formulated.

THE COURT: Objection sustained. The way it is phrased calls for speculation. You can ask him the fact of his opinion.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. A normal reading of that is that, and your reading of that is that the child developed anemia from the bleeding from the amnio. That is why she needed the fluid resuscitation because she had low blood pressure at birth.

A. That is what it says there. I don’t think there is evidence that there was continued, active bleeding after the amniocentesis. As I said before —

Q. Okay.

A. — it was a little bit of bleeding.

MR. PEAKE: Your Honor, do not cut him off in the explanation.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. Go ahead.

A. That a, when the biophysical profile was done at 9:30 or about an hour after the amniocentesis, there was no evidence of any active bleeding. I would anticipate and I would expect that if continued bleeding occurred to the point where to cause this baby to become anemic and distressed, you would have seen it during that study.

Q. But then that gives you zero explanation for why the baby needed fluid resuscitation at birth because she had a low tank of gas.

A. Well, I think you could explain that by the events of a partial abruption or the events that happened on the 2nd or 3rd or 4th of November prior to the amniocentesis.

Q. You already told us that it only takes hours to restore from the interstitial fluids.

A. I didn’t, you may not get a complete restoration, but it may take more than just a couple of hours.

Q. Days?

A. It might. I don’t have what happens in utero, but it certainly might.

Q. So you don’t know what happens in utero so it is just pure speculation?

A. I don’t know if anybody has that data as to how long it takes for a blood volume to equilibrate in a fetus in utero two or three days prior to delivery. I just don’t think that data is available.

Q. All right. So, you are saying he is just wrong?

A. I don’t see the evidence for coming to that conclusion. I don’t find any evidence that there was active bleeding after the amniocentesis. In fact, the evidence is quite the opposite, that there was no active bleeding.

Q. And then on his second page he talks about his plans, and the second item he puts is “Anemia, acute blood loss after amniocentesis, hematocrit 27 at birth, monitor hematocrit with transfusions if clinically indicated.” Right?

A. Again, I don’t know what the procedure is, but I distinctly remember reading in another admission history and physical, and I don’t know who it was by, where it specifically mentioned abruption of the placenta at University of Virginia in the day or two after this baby’s admission. And given time — I have my records in the car — I can get them for you if you would like.

Q. I’ve got dozens of pages to show you that talk about the amniocentesis.

A. I have a tab.

Q. I will let you do that at the break. We will let you do that at the break. Let’s see. This reminds me of one other thing. You said you, as a neonatologist, would get involved in counseling moms who have difficult birth situations. Right?

A. Typically we do, yes.

Q. And even after birth?

A. Correct.

Q. And so did anybody ever counsel Marsha Simpson, We think you had a placental abruption and it could increase the risk for a future baby problem?

A. I don’t recall that happening. I don’t know what happened, whether the obstetricians talked with her. There was no neonatologist involved in this care. It was a general pediatrician.

Q. It didn’t happen, did it?

A. I don’t think the part —

Q. There are two options on it not happening, the counseling. One is these guys derelicted their —

MR. PEAKE: I am going to object here, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained. Calls for legal conclusion.

MR. PEAKE: This goes to what we have been dealing with for a long time in this case.

THE COURT: I don’t think you want to go there.

MR. PEAKE: I think he already has, Your Honor. We would like to be heard after this witness rests. It has gone too far.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. Okay. So let’s talk about the —

THE COURT: Let’s take a recess now, let’s do that. Members of the jury, you take about ten minutes.

THE COURT: Mr. Malone, you may proceed with the witness.

MR. MALONE: Thank you, Your Honor.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. You had a chance to go out in your car and check the records?

A. I did, yes.

Q. And the record that you found that had the most information about a possible placental abruption is this one here?

A. Well, there are actually two records. This one and then there was one I think that was related to a radiological procedure that in the assessment said placental abruption as well.

Q. That radiology thing was just a brief note, and you couldn’t tell if it was history or what it was. Right?

A. It was just on the report, yes, that’s correct.

Q. It wasn’t an evaluation of anybody’s placenta?

A. It was not.

Q. Now, on this note here you are relying on this top part here?

A. Well, I think what struck me as the top part, which at least considered the possibility of an abruption, it says “during amniocentesis.” And again, I did not find any evidence of abruption during the amniocentesis.

Q. Well, let’s take a quick look at it. We are doing this as the Judge said, just to get the basis of whether you have a good basis for your opinions. The part you circled there, let’s talk a little bit about how these consultation requests were. This is a request from a, whoever that is in the upper left corner, the requesting physician. Right?

A. That’s correct.

Q. To the consultant service, it looks like pediatric neurology maybe?

A. Maybe peds renal or peds ren.

Q. The fact that there is a number here, 6197, that is usually a designation that the requesting physician who has written the top part is a resident in training. True?

A. Well, I am not sure that is always true. We all have numbers, attendings and residents have numbers assigned to them for the purpose of paging and per dictation. At least in our hospital every physician, every nurse practitioner has a number.

Q. Well, in any event, what you are relying on is this part here that says, “Reason for consultation, requests 37-week infant born by crash C-section secondary to abruption during amniocentesis with likely anoxia-related”

A. “Seizures” it looks like.

Q. “Anoxia-related seizures and clinical evidence of ATD,” that is that acute tubular necrosis, the kidney damage. Right?

A. Correct.

Q. That is referring to some kidney valves?

A. Yes.

Q. The BUN and creatinine?

A. Correct.

Q. Now, what the consultant wrote, I guess you have not paid attention to?

A. I have.

Q. What the consultant wrote was, “Infant was delivered by crash C-section at outside hospital after suffering acute blood loss during when amniocentesis needle came in contact with placenta. At delivery amniotic fluid was grossly bloody and infant was pale and floppy. Apgar is 5, 5, and 9.” So in terms of whether this record really helps you to support your opinion that other people were thinking about the possibility of a placental defect, it is kind of a tie ball game, isn’t it?

A. Yes. I am just saying it raised the issue of whether there was, in fact, an abruption. I didn’t find any evidence that there was any bleeding related to the amniocentesis.

Q. Sure. But the, and even with, even what both of them said is they are not talking about a remote event, they are talking about an event after an amniocentesis.

A. Well, again, just because it is there doesn’t mean it happened. I think there is a strong potential that this is an erroneous conclusion and it got carried on in the UVA records in perpetuity. I think there is very little evidence that this baby had an injury related to an amniocentesis for the reasons I said before.

Q. Right. Now, let’s go to the reasons that you said about this being a prior detachment or abruption of the placenta. Okay?

A. Okay.

Q. Now, the first reason you gave us on your list of reasons, if I remember right, was that the —

MR. MALONE: And Mr. Peake, we have dealt with this issue about the —

MR. PEAKE: I did not have a chance to talk to Dr. Karotkin. Can I just approach?

THE COURT: Let’s take —

MR. PEAKE: I can just tell him, one second.

MR. MALONE: That is fine.

THE COURT: Members of the jury, we will let Mr. Peake talk to the witness for just a moment. This is part of the side bar that happened. Was I right? This is, again, something that doesn’t affect your deliberations and shouldn’t be considered. This is a housekeeping way of shoving things through and keeping things moving within the parameters that this law has established.

(Pause in the proceedings while Mr. Peake and the witness were outside of the courtroom.)

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. Okay. So this reason number one that you gave us was you were relying on evidence that Mrs. Simpson, the weekend before the Monday morning amniocentesis, had cramping pain.

A. That’s correct.

Q. Okay. You got that from Dr. Roberts. True?

A. That is correct.

Q. Mrs. Simpson testified both in her deposition and at trial that she had back pain but no cramping pain over that prior weekend. Were you aware of that?

A. I was aware of that, yes.

Q. And you saw in the record of November 5th, the record of the amniocentesis, that it mentioned that immediately after the amniocentesis she has cramping back pain.

A. I believe that is true, yes.

Q. And she testified that she had huge cramping pain right after that amniocentesis. I will just ask you to accept that, you can imagine.

A. I think that is probably true, yes.

Q. Okay. So if she didn’t have cramping pain the prior weekend, that would undercut one of the key bases of your opinion.
A. Well, yes and no. Again, in my experience, women that have an abruption frequently present with lower back pain.

Q. We are talking about cramping pain was what you said you were relying on. Now you are changing it to back pain?

A. I am just saying back pain and/or cramping pain.

Q. Women get back pain all the time late in pregnancy. They are carrying around a heavy baby.

A. I am just saying it is not proof of an abruption, but certainly taken with all of the other evidence it certainly supports my opinion that there was an event related to an abruption or partial abruption prior to the amniocentesis.

Q. Even if she had no cramping pain?

A. Correct, yes.

Q. So any woman who has back pain late in pregnancy — well, skip that. Now, let’s talk about the anatomy of a placental abruption and where it happens. Let me do my own little diagram. This will probably be somewhat laughable, but here is the question I want to ask you. As I understand the anatomy, and you correct me if I am wrong, here we’ve got an amniotic sac and we have a baby inside here. And we’ve got an umbilical cord that connects up here to a placenta which is outside the amniotic sac. Right?

A. Correct.

Q. And then when these blood vessels or when the umbilical cord leaves the amniotic sac, by the way, there is a tight connection, otherwise the mom would be leaking amniotic fluid all the time. Right?

A. Correct.

Q. So what happens is everything kind of fans out in terms of blood vessels and we’ve got, up here we’ve got the mom’s uterus, and actually the uterus should be in a tight connection with the placenta. It has to be for life. Correct?

A. Correct.

Q. What happens in the placental abruption is on the mom’s side, you’ve got baby’s side next to the amniotic sac. You have got the mom’s side next to the uterus. Right?

A. Correct.

Q. Let me show you, this is a little better. So this connection right here, here we’ve got the placenta being in tight connection with the uterus, which is necessary for the baby.

A. Okay.

MR. KRASNOW: Can everybody see this now?

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. In a normal situation. Right?

A. Correct.

Q. Okay. Now, to get an abruption, you get a detachment of the placenta up here and you start developing basically a sac of blood in between the uterus and the placenta. And it is what they call a potential space that then fills with blood. Right?

A. Correct.

Q. And I think as you told us the mom, it is usually maternal bleeding. Right?

A. Most of the time it is. It can be fetal bleeding, but my experience and I think the literature would indicate it was mostly maternal blood.

Q. As I remember your theory was that this was likely maternal bleeding and then mom developed low blood pressure and then that caused the lack of perfusion to the baby.

A. Something like that, yes. There was some event that occurred related to the abruption that interfered with the blood flow and oxygen delivered to the baby.

Q. Okay. But mom losing is blood. Right?

A. Typically, yes. There may be some blood loss from the baby as well.

Q. Sure, I understand. I understand. So here is, and let’s just take a quick look at what you identified for me a second ago when the jury was out, the standard diagrams of what a placental abruption can look like in a uterus. And what we have here, for example, on the, this illustration, by the way, there is three or three-and-a-half of them here, Frank Netter was a famous medical doctor who, actually I guess he went to medical school drawing rather than writing notes and people realized his talent and he became an —

A. An illustrator rather than a practicing physician.

Q. Okay. So Dr. Netter has written up these illustrations for us. They basically are showing us three different abruptions that are abruptions significant enough to cause injury to a baby. You don’t care about ones that are little tiny ones. Right?

A. Well, to me they seem like exaggerated abruptions for sure. I think there certainly is potential for much smaller abruptions to cause a problem as well.

Q. Well, you have got to lose enough blood
one way or the other for either the baby to lose enough blood or the mom to lose enough blood to cause loss of blood flow to the baby. Right?

A. No, that is correct, but I think you could still do that with a much smaller abruption than seems to be illustrated here.

Q. But you don’t know the size of the abruption that would be, say the minimize size to cause injury?

A. I don’t know, no.

Q. Okay. And actually a frequent sign of abruption is mom starts bleeding out of her vagina.

A. I don’t know how frequently, but certainly that is a sign of an abruption, yes.

Q. The only way that you can get an abruption and not have the mom bleeding is if somehow, it is like in this upper right area where this blood is and that is squeezed into a space where the baby is blocking the passage outside, to the outside world?

A. Again, here you can see the abruption is lower and is not coming through the vagina as well.

Q. Well, either one. But the point is you have got to have a cork in the bottle to prevent the blood from —

A. I would say as a generalization, sure.

Q. Okay. So we have no vaginal bleeding here. Right?

A. That’s correct.

Q. We have no signs, no evidence of mom having low blood pressure.

A. I think that’s correct, yes.

Q. And we have no signs of mom having a low blood count before this baby was born, do we?

A. I don’t recall what the matter of her hemoglobin was, I don’t recall that it was particularly low, no. I think it was low normal.

Q. Isn’t that a thing you would want to see?

A. Well, again, typically if her hematocrit were 42 or 43 and then it was down to 30, then you could anticipate based on that progression that there was some anemia. I don’t recall offhand what her hematocrit was.

Q. She has on, the only hematocrit that we have that is taken before the baby is born is right here. Now, she’s got, let’s look at the highlighted one. You see she’s got one on November 5th at 11:25 in the morning, and then right above that at 5 a.m. After the baby is born November 6th, she has another one. Right?

A. That is correct.

Q. So she has lost a little blood from the surgery, the C-section. Do you see that?

A. Yes.

Q. So it is a little on the low side after the baby is born, you see she has got a hemoglobin of 11 and a hematocrit of 31.7. Right?

A. That’s correct.

Q. And then we see the normal range being hemoglobin 12 to 16, hematocrit 36 to 46. By the way, just so we avoid confusion, these are adult norms, not baby norms.

A. I understand that, yes.

Q. Right?

A. Right.

Q. Okay. So now we look at her hemoglobin, which is taken about an hour or so after the biophysical profile. It is in the normal range, right, 13?

A. Just barely.

Q. And her hematocrit is also in the normal range.

A. Just barely over normal.

Q. Okay. Women often run lower hematocrits than men do. True?

A. That is true.

Q. Okay. So this doesn’t give you any evidence that mom has enough bleeding to cause such a loss of her own blood perfusion that her baby would have suffered a massive injury like this.

A. Well, what you could reason is that her normal hematocrit was 42, 43, or 44 and it bled down to 36. I am just saying that is a possibility. I am not saying it is —

Q. Speculation?

A. That is a possibility.

Q. Speculation, sir, isn’t it? I am just looking for an explanation.

MR. BATTEN: Your Honor —

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. It is not an opinion that you can hold within a reasonable degree of probability because you didn’t look into what her normal hemoglobin or hematocrit was, did you?

A. You are just asking for possibilities. That is certainly a possibility.

Q. I am just trying to ask for what the real basis of the opinion is. So that is that one. Now, and by the way, a mom who is losing so much blood that she is losing perfusion to her baby, wouldn’t you expect her to faint or show some other signs of, you know, something serious going on?

A. I don’t think necessarily she would, number one. She is in bed in labor or prodromal labor. Number two —

Q. Sir, she was active all weekend long.

A. I am talking about in the hospital when her hematocrit was done on the 5th.

Q. No, we are talking about your theory of the prior weekend mom losing so much blood that she lost, that the baby lost blood flow. And yet we have a mother who by her testimony, her mother Pearlie testified, her husband testified, perfectly normal weekend, she is running around, nobody is feeling faint, nobody has got any problems.

A. Well, again, in my view you can still loculate or bleed a significant amount of blood behind the placenta. Might not affect the mother’s condition, she may feel perfectly normal, but may affect perfusion to the baby. It would, in my view, take more than 2 or 3 or 400 ccs of blood for her to have symptoms of being faint and tired.

Q. And you just don’t know.

A. I am just saying that is certainly a good possibility.

Q. Now, here is my other question going back to my little diagram here. If we have an amniotic sac that is totally intact when the baby is born and then Dr. Terry opens it up and he sees grossly bloody fluid, not outside the sac, but inside the sac. Right?

A. Correct.

Q. And we know the baby has been swallowing blood during the day of November 5th.

A. Correct.

Q. So tell me, how does that blood in the placenta from outside here get into the intact amniotic cavity —

A. Well, it is something —

Q. — unless there has been a needle stick and then there has been bleeding caused inside the amniotic sac?

A. Well, I have seen blood in the amniotic cavity without a needle stick being performed. And my assumption is that it breaks through somewhere between the integrity of the area behind the placenta and the amniotic sac.

Q. Your assumption is. You have absolutely no —

A. I am saying I have seen dark blood, I have seen clotted blood in the amniotic fluid at Cesarean section absent amniocentesis.

Q. But you have also seen amniocentesis that, where the patient develops so much bleeding that they have to have an emergency delivery.

A. I have not seen that, no.

Q. Well, you know about it, don’t you?

A. I think it is very, very rare.

Q. It does happen.

A. It can happen. It is very rare. In this situation, there is evidence that there was no bleeding an hour after the amniocentesis was done. I think it is hard to postulate that bleeding continued over the next 10 or 11 hours if there is no evidence of active bleeding at an hour after the amniocentesis was performed.

Q. But one thing missing from your whole line of testimony, because you told us you weren’t qualified, is the baby’s neurological cry for help, which namely the fetal heart tracings, are something you just don’t consider one way or the other because you are not qualified. Right?

A. I didn’t say I didn’t consider them. I don’t feel qualified to read them. I would certainly regard them based on an expert’s reading of them, but I don’t feel qualified to read them.

Q. You know that the baby’s heart rate lost variability during the day.

A. I am not so sure of that. I can’t testify that it did or didn’t. I am not convinced it did.

Q. All right. Well, you are not convinced because you have no independent way to tell. Right?

A. I think you would have to rely on the experts for reading those monitoring strips.

Q. Well, actually couldn’t you also just look at the, what the nurses wrote and what Dr. Lambert and Dr. Badillo noted about poor variability, loss of variability? Did you see all of that in the record?

A. I did, yes.

Q. Are you saying that Dr. Badillo and the nurses were wrong when they thought there was loss of variability in this baby?

A. I am not saying that they are wrong. I am just saying just because there is loss of variability doesn’t necessarily mean there is an absolute indication to proceed to Cesarean section.

Q. That is not your area.

A. Well, you are asking me about it.

Q. No, I am asking about the basis for an opinion that something had happened some prior day as opposed to on this very day.

A. Um-um.

Q. And I thought you said that everything was hunky-dory after the biophysical profile and therefore that is another reason why the bleeding must have been —

A. I said everything was fine from the bleeding standpoint, that there was no evidence of any bleeding after the amniocentesis.

Q. Okay. Now, one more thing on this placental abruption thing. Assuming it happened, there is no way that this thing went away from the weekend of November 4th or 3rd, whatever, until delivery. It doesn’t happen that way, it doesn’t get reabsorbed or something to —

A. No, I wouldn’t think so, not in a short period of time.

Q. So if she had a placental abruption on November 3rd or 4th, she would still have had it an November 5th?

A. I would think that would be true, yes.

Q. Have you seen pictures of abrupted placentas, have you seen an abrupted placenta itself?

A. Yes.

Q. It is usually pretty obvious if it has been bad enough to cause enough bleeding that it hurts the baby.

A. Again, I am not an expert when it comes to that, but certainly the ones I have seen have been pretty remarkable.

Q. Remarkable, pretty obvious.

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. Let me show you a quick picture. Tell me if this is kind of like the ones you have seen. This is Plaintiffs 3 marked for identification.

A. I think that is along the lines of what I have seen.

MR. MALONE: Okay. I will move that into evidence.

MR. PEAKE: Your Honor, we object to that being shown to the jury right now until we can deal with it.

MR. MALONE: Okay.

THE COURT: Mark it for identification and I will consider it at a later time.

MR. MALONE: If I can ask just a little more foundational stuff.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. What we are seeing on this is a large area over on the left side of this photograph of the placenta where it is kind of, well, you tell me.

A. It looks like old clotted blood.

Q. Old clotted blood. And it is dark and ugly?

A. Well, it is interesting.

Q. To use my layman’s expression.

A. It is dark and coagulated. I wouldn’t describe it as ugly.

Q. It doesn’t look healthy. We will leave that for now. Here is my other question. If she had
the abruption before she got to that amnio, and by the way, do you have any theory why the baby would have a completely normal heartbeat before the amnio if it had already been hurt?

A. Well, I think there is a potential, again —

Q. Are we talking possibilities or probabilities?

A. I think in this situation there it is a probability that the baby sustained an injury and then recovered to the point where the heart rate was normal just prior to the amniocentesis; that there was some catastrophic event that occurred on the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th which affected the baby’s kidneys and brain, and the baby had some degree of recovery prior to the amniocentesis.

Q. You don’t know enough about fetal heart rates to know whether a brain damaged baby can put out a heartbeat that looks absolutely normal with normal accelerations and normal variability, do you, sir?

A. Well, again, in general I know that a completely devastated baby from the neurological standpoint would probably have a fixed heart rate and would not be able to respond to —

Q. Flat line?

A. Flat line, yes.

Q. Okay. But you don’t know any evidence that a baby can sustain a severe enough injury to have brain and kidney damage and yet somehow after that show a nice, bouncy, and variable and accelerative heartbeat?

A. Again, I think it depends on the degree of brain damage. I think in this situation there was not total brain damage. In the situations that I have been involved in where there is complete brain damage, these babies don’t recover from the neurological standpoint. They are essentially brain dead. I think this baby did have some degree of neurological activity. I think she is doing reasonably well 10 or 11 years later.

Q. Is she?

A. She is not in a completely vegetative state, let me put it that way.

Q. Of course, you have never met the child.

A. I have not. I have seen descriptions. I am saying she is not in a completely vegetative state.

Q. Well, I guess that is something. But here is the other thing I wanted to ask you. She’s, you say it is your opinion that if she had this detachment or abruption over that prior weekend, it is still going to be there on November 5th. Right?

A. It should be, yes.

Q. Okay. And we know it is in what they call an anterior placenta, here is the belly, here is the feet down here, here is the mother’s head. Right?

A. That is what is described as an anterior placenta, yes.

Q. The doctor’s ultrasound wand is going right up here. Correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And he is holding the wand, moving the wand around, Dr. Roberts was moving the wand around, looking for a pocket of fluid.

A. That’s correct.

Q. If there had been a pocket of blood there, especially a large enough pocket of blood that it would have caused severe brain and kidney damage to a baby it should have been visible.

A. Again, you are asking the wrong person. I am not an expert when it comes to reading them. You are putting me on the spot. I know from my reading of them —

Q. That is my job.

A. — for these kind of patients that sometimes abruptions are very hard to determine by ultrasound, so —

Q. Especially if the placenta is down on the bottom of the uterus. Right?

A. Again, I can’t offer you expert opinion when it comes to the likelihood of detecting an abruption by ultrasound.

Q. Okay. Well, didn’t it seem curious to you that we had in this case, even after Dr. Roberts did his ultrasound thing, we had what I guess in layman’s terms you could call a surveillance video that went on for half an hour or more of that mom’s placenta and uterus and everything inside. There were hundreds of images taken. There were 20 or so that had been preserved in the records, and yet there isn’t a single sign of anything detached in that placenta. Didn’t that seem odd to you?

A. Again, to me it didn’t. I am not expert in reading those studies and I didn’t feel I was qualified to determine how common or how rare that would be.

Q. I thought you said you read Dr. Filly’s testimony.

A. I did, yes.

Q. And he showed how the placenta is up here, the uterus is up here, and then all of the images he looked at absolutely no evidence of any placental abruption.

A. That’s correct.

Q. So basically what you are postulating is a huge but invisible injury.

A. Well, I am not sure I would put it that way. I am postulating that there is some event that occurred on the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th which was significant enough to cause this baby to have decreased blood flow, decreased oxygen to the brain and kidneys to cause this injury. It was more likely that it occurred during that time period than appeared after the amniocentesis or prior to delivery.

Q. All of this grossly bloody fluid in here and the baby swallowing the blood and vomiting up the blood, that is just coincidence? That is from the amnio that it is coincidence?

A. I don’t think it is from the amnio. I think it is from the abruption, whatever happened on the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

Q. How did it get into the amniotic cavity without breaking the membrane?

A. Well, I think it had to break the membrane to get into there, it had a leak in there somewhere.

Q. But we had intact membranes at birth according to Dr. Terry.

A. Well, you can still have intact membranes but still have some kind of leak which has sealed over or intermittently open.

Q. Right. That is not your area of

A. No.

MR. MALONE: That is all I have.
Q. Did you ever wonder, Dr. Christmas, why your phone never rings from plaintiffs’ lawyers?

A. It never crossed my mind, no.

Q. It didn’t possibly cross your mind that you were one of those guys who could always be counted on if there is any issue where it might be a little bit of ambiguity that you would slice it for the healthcare provider? That didn’t ever occur to you?

A. With all due respect, I swore to tell the truth about three hours ago, and I take that very seriously.

***
Q. Let’s talk about choices for the patient. I thought you had told us in your deposition that in terms of making a recommendation for Marsha Simpson of do we go to early delivery preceded by an amnio or not, you would have been on the fence for her.

A. I think exactly what I said, I don’t remember the exact words, but I said that I don’t know what I would have done and I couldn’t make that comment without actually seeing the patient.

Q. Well, let me quote you exactly what you said.
MR. BATTEN: Do you have a copy for him?

MR. MALONE: I have a lousy copy.

MR. PEAKE: I have got a good one. This is January 22, 2009?

MR. MALONE: Yes.

MR. BATTEN: We have an excellent copy.

Mr. MALONE: Great.

THE WITNESS: Do you know what page we are on?

BY MR. MALONE: Yes, we are on page 40, line 1.

THE WITNESS: Page on the portion of 40 and 41 or page of the deposition?

MR. PEAKE: The deposition.

THE WITNESS: Of the deposition, okay. I won’t lose your place.

MR. MALONE: It usually works. Could I just have one second?

THE COURT: Sure.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. “In regards to Marsha Simpson, if I am correctly interpreting what you are saying to me, it is that you don’t have enough information because you are unable to examine the patient to tell me what you would have recommended to her as a course of treatment. Is that a fair characterization?”

Your answer, “Well, it may be a fair characterization, but in point of fact the vast majority of the patients that I see in this circumstance, well, not the vast majority but a substantial number of patients that I see in this circumstance, I don’t necessarily make a recommendation. I give the patients what both of the options are and I allow them to sort of make a choice between the two. But there are certainly some that I am very directed in my counseling about and there are others who I tend to be fairly non directive.”

A. Right. That’s kind of what I just said.

Q. Okay. Now, my point, though, is you don’t know what you would have necessarily recommended for her, and the point is you would have given her some choices.

A. I may or I may not have. If you look at what I said before that, you, Mr. Krasnow, asked me, “If Marsha Simpson had been your patient, what would your recommendation have been?” I don’t know that I would have, I don’t know what my recommendation would have been without seeing her and without standing at the bedside in 2001. And the medical records, voluminous as they are, do not necessarily provide the entire picture that you would have the clinician standing at the bedside. In many patients, like what is described in the medical records, I would have a conversation with the patient regarding what I just described a few minutes ago with you. You for these reasons have an increased risk of late-term stillbirth. You, because of gestational diabetes, have an increased risk of delayed fetal lung maturation. Your glucose control looks like it has improved since 34 weeks, and that is good. Whether or not that totally normalizes the risk of stillbirth that is incurred because of poor glycemic control early in the pregnancy is an unanswerable question. And as such, you and I can figure out what is the best thing for you. We would go into a discussion about all of those aspects and make a decision. There are times when I make specific recommendations and I would say to somebody, Based on all of the issues in this case, I would rather see you undergo amniocentesis and undergo early induction.

Q. What I got from those two quotes, putting them together, and you correct me if I am wrong, is that studying her records there is no clear cut, Man, she needs to go straight to early induction preceded by amnio. At least that is my —

A. Based on that information, that is, I don’t know that there is a mandate to do that.

Q. Okay. Options, there are options.

A. Again, but, if a clinician taking care of the patient looks at the patient and makes a clinical assessment that says I believe, I believe that the risk of stillbirth outweighs the risk of effective management, for a physician to say, Oh, do whatever you want, is irresponsible.

Q. No, no, we are not talking about that. We are talking about having a dialogue with a patient and giving the patient the information so the patient can make an intelligent choice. Isn’t that what medical standards require in the Commonwealth of Virginia?

A. To a certain degree, yes. But I think to —

Q. To —

A. No.

Q. Only to a certain degree?

A. Yes, only to a certain degree. I think when you, to allow a patient to make a bad decision and to not imply to the patient that that is a bad decision is inappropriate.

Q. Well, let me show you how I had put it earlier, how one of the other experts had put it earlier.

MR. PEAKE: Your Honor, he cannot and I object to showing testimony from, we don’t know where it is from.

MR. MALONE: This is cross examination.

MR. PEAKE: You don’t get to show testimony.

THE COURT: You can ask him if agrees with the statement or not.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. “If there are reasonable options, the obstetrician must inform the patient so the patient can make an intelligent choice.”

A. Define “reasonable.”

Q. Reasonable options, you —

A. You just asked me to define a word. I am asking you to define reasonable. That is the —

THE COURT: Do you agree with that statement or not?

THE WITNESS: I agree with that statement.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. Okay. So, because it is the patient’s choice, it is the patient’s life, they are the ones that have to live with it. Right?

A. To a degree I agree with that.

Q. Okay. And so, you had told us also in your deposition, that if, let me back up a second. You showed us the informed consent form or Mr. Batten did, showed us the informed consent form. She signed it.

A. Okay.

Q. I want you to plug in one additional fact, that the patient read the form and signed it because she had not been presented any options and she thought the amnio was a test that she had to have. Are you willing to assume that?

A. Hypothetically or in this case?

Q. Hypothetically and in this case because she testified to this, and you can’t judge credibility one way or the other, can you?

A. If that is what she testified to, then I have no way to contradict that. I can only demonstrate that the form says that she understood.

Q. Right. And plenty of patients —

A. And she signed the form.

Q. Sure. And plenty of patients think they understand because they trust their doctor —

A. Where is that at?

Q. I am asking you a question.

A. You just told me something.

Q. I am trying to ask you a question, sir.

A. Okay.

Q. Isn’t it true that plenty of patients trust doctors enough that they assume that the doctor is going to give them the options if there are options.

A. I don’t know whether that statement is true or not.

Q. Well, we will let the jury judge that, then. The point is didn’t you also tell us in your deposition that if there had been no presentation of options, amnio versus —

A. Right.

Q. — expectant management, and by the way, expectant management, watchful waiting —

A. Right.

Q. — would have been a reasonable option for this patient?

A. It would have been an option for this patient. I think that in Dr. Roberts’ testimony that the —

Q. We don’t get to quote Dr. Roberts.

A. No, you are asking me if I believe a discussion occurred and in Dr. Roberts’ —

THE COURT: He is not asking you that at all. You are not to comment on that.

THE WITNESS: Okay.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. So the point is that didn’t you also tell us that if the two options of watchful waiting versus straight to amnio, do not pass go and then we will have an elected induction had not been presented to this patient, that would violate the Virginia standard of care?

A. Correct.

Q. You did say that and you stand by that testimony?

A. I agree with that.

Q. Okay. So that is just an issue that the jury is going to have to decide who is right on this. If Dr. Roberts just told her, This is what we are going to do, I am going to do, I am going to put you to early induction and I am going to test the lungs ahead of time, and he didn’t give her options, that would be wrong and that would violate the standard of care if that is what they conclude. True?

A. That is true.
Q. Okay. And similarly, let’s talk about another critical choice time. 10:30 A.m., mom has had her biophysical profile. It has come back 4 out of 8. By the way, just one tiny little segue here, that business about the fetal breathing, the quote you were reading from talked about loss of variability and fetal breathing being the first to go.

A. Well, I don’t have the quote sitting in front of me. My clinical experience, having reviewed literally thousands of biophysical profiles, has to do with fetal breathing.

Q. Let’s just look at the quote to make sure we have it right.

MR. BATTEN: Of course I have it right here for you, Pat.

MR. MALONE: Thank you.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. This was your man Callen, totally reliable authority. Right?

A. Keep going.

MR. BATTEN: Objection to the commentary, Your Honor. Is there a question?

THE COURT: He’s getting to it. Objection overruled.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. “Data have demonstrated in fetal acidemia,” that is the acidosis we are talking about, “The first biophysical activities to become compromised are fetal heart rate, reactivity, and fetal breathing.”

A. Correct. That is what I said.

Q. I thought you said fetal breathing, but —

MR. BATTEN: You might want to read this one, too.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. In this case, this patient had lost at least some, and maybe not all the time, had lost fetal heart rate reactivity, didn’t she?

A. You are confusing variability and reactivity. But in point of fact, my understanding of that, everyone I know’s understanding of that, my own clinical experience with that would suggest that fetal breathing is the most important part of the sonographic portion of a biophysical profile.

Q. Actually, you know, there is this thing called an abbreviated biophysical profile. Right? You are familiar with it?

A. There are a couple of different iterations of it.

Q. And the abbreviated one uses two things: It uses amniotic fluid and fetal heart rate. True?

A. That is true. There is also an abbreviated biophysical profile test that says if
fetal breathing movements are identified, you don’t need to do the rest of the study.

Q. Okay. But there are others that say, just like I said, which is if you want to go with a couple of things —

A. Do a nonstress test and amniotic fluid index.

Q. Right. And Dr. Terry thought she didn’t pass the nonstress test at 9:20. That is why he ordered the biophysical profile. Right?

A. Correct.

Q. Was he wrong?

A. No. As I said before, I think it was an imminently appropriate decision not to send her home.

Q. Okay. But now we reach the decision point at 10:30 in the morning.

A. Right.

Q. And there were two reasonable options then, weren’t there, sir?

A. Well, I don’t know that I would say there were two reasonable options. I think there were two options. Well, I think there were three options.

Q. Reasonable options, let’s stick with reasonable options.

A. I agree it would have been unreasonable to send her home.

Q. Actually, let me just back up a second. I thought I wrote down — and I wrote a bunch of little notes here — I thought I wrote down that one thing you said on direct examination that at 10:30 A.m. a Cesarean section was, quote, absolutely not indicated.

A. I don’t recall if I used the word “absolutely,” but I have no problem with the word absolutely. That is a Cesarean section at 10:30 was not, the benefits of a Cesarean section based on the data that was available at 10:30 were far outweighed by the risk of Cesarean section. And so I think at that time to have told the patient, Oh, we ought to deliver you by C-section or you can deliver either by C-section or vaginally, and either way is a reasonable option and there is not a hierarchy between the two, would have been inappropriate and outside of the standard of care.

Q. Okay. Now you are totally changing your deposition testimony. Do you have your transcript there?

A. Sure.

Q. Look at page 90.

A. Nine zero?

Q. Yes, sir.

MR. BATTEN: Objection to just the announcement of comments. Can he just ask questions, Your Honor?

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. I am sorry. “What were the treatment options for Marsha Simpson and her fetus following the biophysical profile?” Answer, “The treatment options were” —

A. Where are you?

MR. PEAKE: Page 90, line 10.

THE WITNESS: I got it, okay.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. Are you there? “The treatment options were to do nothing, which I think would have been totally inappropriate, to deliver her at that point by Cesarean section, to deliver her by induction of labor, or to monitor her in an open-ended fashion without a plan for delivery.”

Question, “Would a decision to proceed with a C-section at that point in time have been within the standard of care?”

The answer, “I believe it would have been.”

A. That is a different question than what I you just asked me.

Q. Question, “So if I am interpreting what you have been telling me, Doctor, the viable, the best treatment options were either delivery through induction or delivery through Cesarean section?”

Answer, “That’s my opinion.” And then he asks you about who made the decision to proceed with induction, and you said Dr. Terry?

A. That is a different question than what you asked me a minute ago. You didn’t ask me a minute ago if it would have been in the standard of care to deliver her by Cesarean section. Twenty-five percent of babies born in the United States are delivered by Cesarean section. It is kind of hard to ever look someone in the eye and say it would have been absolutely outside the standard of care to do a Cesarean section.

Q. No, sir. No, sir.

A. Let me finish my answer.

Q. Okay.

A. If the difference, or the question you asked was, I think was would it have been appropriate.

Q. I asked you would it have been a reasonable option.

A. Okay.

Q. I thought you said —

A. That is a different thing from the standard of care, would it have complied with the standard of care.

Q. Let’s not quibble with each other. You said right here that the best treatment options were either delivery through induction or delivery through Cesarean section. Answer, “That is my opinion.”

A. That is my opinion today.

Q. So those —

A. Let me finish my answer.

Q. A reasonable —

A. Let me finish my answer. Those are the best two options.

Q. You are just an arguer.

THE COURT: All right, Gentlemen.

THE WITNESS: The best two options were induction or Cesarean section.

THE COURT: Hang on a minute, Doctor. Just state your next question.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. Let me state my question, sir.

A. Okay.

Q. So if the two, if the best treatment options were either delivery through induction or through C-section at 10:30 in the morning, the patient deserved to know that.

A. Because those were the best two of the four listed does not mean that they were equal in any shape or form.

Q. I didn’t ask that. I asked if the patient deserved to know.

A. You told me the patient deserved to know. I didn’t realize you were asking me. Yes, there are probably some issues or there are probably, I can’t imagine having a discussion with a patient about, in this clinical circumstance, where the
discussion didn’t, I mean, the options are kind of implied. And so I don’t know, you know, we need to get you delivered, I don’t think that there are many patients that don’t realize there are two ways to get delivered. And the discussion that I have with the patient, if I thought a Cesarean section was clearly the best way to deliver the patient, I would tell the patient that. If I thought that induction of labor was the better of those two options to deliver somebody, I would tell them that.

Q. I thought you told us somewhere in your deposition that somebody needed to, whoever it was, somebody needed to tell this patient, Marsha Simpson, “We have options here and here is what they are” at 10:30 in the morning.

A. I don’t know if I said at 10:30 in the morning. I think whenever you are talking to somebody about delivering them, I don’t know how you can have a discussion with somebody where the issue of options doesn’t come out, I mean —

Q. Well, here is a way you can do it. If you just tell the patient: We are going to induce labor, Mrs. Simpson. Hi, I am Dr. Lambert.

A. I don’t know that that conversation did or didn’t occur.

Q. Okay. If that is the only way it happened, and she wasn’t offered the option, well, let me put it this way, 10:30 in the morning or 11, in that timeframe: Mrs. Simpson, we have had this biophysical profile, the score is 4 out of 10. You know, there are some things going on here. Some people might think, and there are two options, we can go for an induction, although your cervix isn’t very ripe and everything. Or we can go for an immediate C-section if that is what you would like to do. That is something that should have been —

A. I don’t know.

Q. Let me finish my sentence and then you get to finish your answer. That is something that should have been presented to this patient.

A. Not the way that you just stated it should be presented.

Q. Or some way, some way —

A. I don’t know that it wasn’t.

Q. Well, I am asking you.

A. And I can’t imagine a circumstance in my 30 years of practicing, I have yet to have a patient that didn’t understand there were two possible ways to get delivered. I have not seen one.

Q. Okay. So your —

A. So no, so I would, if I felt, as a clinician, that Cesarean section was a much better option, I would say: I think we need to do a Cesarean section. I believe that the option of induction and labor that everyone knows is there, if I thought that induction was a significantly better route to go, I really would be doing, not doing my job for the patient if I didn’t say: I think we ought to do an induction. And I don’t know that I would sit there and line up every potential risk or complication of Cesarean section.

Q. Because, of course, nobody lined those up for her, did they?

A. I don’t know the answer to that.

Q. Yes. By the way, that list that Mr. Batten was reading from about all of the risks of C-section and whatnot, that didn’t say one word about the baby, did it?

A. I don’t know what list he was reading from.

Q. Well, let’s take a look at it.

MR. BATTEN: I didn’t use it. I read three things. You precluded me from asking about it.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. The answer that you gave about all of the risks of C-section, like blood clots in the mother’s leg and wound infection and stuff like that, none of those were counterbalanced by you in your testimony to say, Well, what about the baby? You didn’t consider that when you were talking about the risk of C-section.

A. Well, I mean, you can’t have any discussion with a patient without involving both sides of that equation. That is not, that is not possible. In clinical practice that can’t happen.

Q. It can’t happen and meet the standard of care is what you are trying to say.

A. No, no, no. What I mean is, again, every one understands A, there is a baby; and B, there is a uterus and there is a vagina and there is an abdomen. There are two ways a baby can come out.

Q. Okay. Let me ask you —

A. And, were you going to let me finish?

Q. It sounds like we are going to get another talk. Can I just ask my next question?

MR. BATTEN: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. Have you ever known a patient who is in pain, severe pain, what someone could assume the lady is in severe pain from, cramping pain from something going on inside her uterus, she can’t tell. And she is presented the option now that there are some parameters that don’t look so good on this baby. We could induce you, we could do an immediate C-section just to make sure that the baby is okay. Most mothers —

A. That might be horrendously irresponsible.

Q. Please, sir, I will finish my question if you don’t mind. Most mothers presented the option of taking risks on themselves versus making absolutely 100 percent sure that we get a good safe baby out now will go for the baby.

MR. BATTEN: Object to the form.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: It would be completely and totally irresponsible.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. What I am trying to say is they will opt for taking risks on themselves if they think that they will, that they can be reducing risks to their baby.

A. It would be completely —

MR. BATTEN: Same objection.

THE WITNESS: — and totally irresponsible to ever tell a patient —

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: — that if I do a Cesarean section now that I can guarantee you this baby is going to be perfectly healthy. That would be absolutely irresponsible.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. I am not asking you —

A. That is what you just said.

Q. I never said, I don’t think I said guarantee.

A. You said 100 percent likelihood the baby would be fine right now and that is coercing a patient.

Q. What I am trying to say is there is a chance there is something wrong with the baby, it could hurt you if we did a C-section, you know, you would get an infection, blah, blah, blah, blah. Do we want to opt on the side of going for the baby now and getting whatever the best baby we can get right now?

A. I think that’s, as an obstetrician, that is your obligation to be making that assessment contemporaneously about what is the best thing for the patient. I don’t think —

Q. And then to communicate —

A. No, I do not think that it is appropriate if the patient has numerous risk factors for surgical delivery and there is not a clear cut indication for surgical delivery to say, “Well, what the hell, let’s do what you want.” I think that is not practicing responsible medicine.

Q. Okay. All right. Let me go to two other quick topics and then we are done. You told us something about Dr. Roberts obtaining dark blood.

A. I don’t remember the exact. If somebody has the labor and delivery sheet I can tell you what it says.

Q. No, Dr. Roberts, the amnio doctor.

A. Right.

Q. He obtained dark blood. It is not in the amnio record. You know that of course.

A. Right. I have read so many records in this case, trying to remember which piece of information came from where.

Q. Trust me on that. But here is the question. If, if he got dark blood, that is something that needs to be moved on right then and there.

A. Not necessarily.

Q. That is what you told me in your deposition.

A. Put it in context.

Q. All right. Let’s take a look. Hang on a second.

A. Thirty-five.

Q. Thirty-four and 35?

A. Okay.

Q. Question, “Have you ever discovered old blood doing an amniocentesis?”

Answer, “More than a dozen.”

Question, “What did it mean to you?”

Answer, “It meant that there had been bleeding into the amniotic cavity.”

Question, “When you discovered old blood, does that indicate that the fetus may be at increased risk?”

Answer, “Oh, yeah.”

Question —

A. I don’t know that I emphasized it like that.

Q. Well, forgive my hyperbole. Maybe you said, “Oh, yeah.” “Oh yeah.”

Question, “Would that indicate that you probably want to expedite the delivery?”

Then first you said, “Not necessarily, because it is at all gestational ages.” And, but then the next question is, “Well, let’s assume that the fetus is viable, in other words, 37, 38 weeks.”

Answer, “Yeah, in a term patient.”

A. I have a different deposition.

MR. KRASNOW: This is the August deposition.

MR. PEAKE: I have got it.

MR. MALONE: This is our follow-up.

THE WITNESS: I couldn’t find where you were.

MR. MALONE: This is follow-up. You talked so much we had to meet with you twice.

THE WITNESS: That wasn’t at my request I promise you. And where are you?

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. And by the way —

THE COURT: Page 34 and 35.

BY MR. MALONE:

Q. Question, “Let’s assume that the fetus is viable.”

Answer, “Yeah.” “In a term patient.” “In this term patient, yeah, I think you would.”

A. Okay. I agree with that.

Q. Okay. So dark blood, if obtained, is something that should have been communicated to the hand-off doctor because it could be a sign something is wrong, we need to move on this baby.

A. Well, I think they did move on this baby. Induction of labor was expediting delivery.

Q. But we are leaving out a fact here, sir.

A. I don’t think that fact has profound relevance here.

Q. It has some relevance.

A. I don’t believe it does, actually, because as I said before, I actually believe all of this happened before then.

Q. By the way, this base excess thing you were talking about, if the base excess is, and you know base excess has to be calculated with hemoglobin plugged in.

A. Right.

Q. Okay. So if the base excess hadn’t had hemoglobin plugged into it, and it turned out it was not plus 7 but was minus 11, it would be right —

A. It is still above the cutoff.

Q. Minus 12, minus 11, you are within the range?

A. No, no, no, cutoffs are cutoffs.

Q. That is not the way it works in medicine, is it, sir? 98.6 degree temperature —

A. I am just telling you there is a body of research that defines acidosis significant enough to cause neurologic injury with a base excess of 12 or greater, period.

Q. Are you —

A. But that is what it is.

Q. Are you familiar with this statistical concept of standard deviations?

A. Absolutely.

Q. That means there is no absolute firm number, for example, like 98 —

A. No. When studies like this are done they are done keeping the standard deviation in mind. That is why you put the cutoff at a 95th percentile or 90th percentile.

Q. We have, there is a bell curve, we have ranges.

A. Cutoffs are placed in ranges to give people actionable points.

Q. Then I guess the final point, and this is a small one, but this sinusoidal-like pattern that we were talking about, you know Dr. Boehm and he is a —

A. I don’t know him well. I know who he is.

Q. Okay. You know he is one of the other expert witnesses for them?

A. Correct.

Q. Did you see his article on intermittent sinusoidal fetal heart rate, the clinical significance of it?

A. I don’t believe I have.

Q. Okay. You wouldn’t doubt that it is reliable authority if he wrote it and he is chosen to be the expert here, would you?

A. I don’t know that he would think that everything I have ever written is wholly reliable or I would think that everything he has ever written is wholly reliable.

Q. Well, let me just put it this way. Is it possible that you can get intermittent sinusoidal type of patterns and that that can be an indication that the baby is anemic?

A. I have never seen it, and I have taken care of well over 100 anemic fetuses every year, well over a couple of hundred.

Q. But if Dr. Boehm had written about it that way, you wouldn’t have any way to dispute it?

A. I would be happy to look at the context in which he wrote it, but I don’t —

Q. Sure.

A. Yes, I think the things that you can take away from this that make this sort of irrelevant, the mean hematocrit in these babies was 17 percent, which is what I spoke to earlier. That would comport with a hemoglobin concentration of about 5 grams per deciliter. This baby had a hemoglobin concentration of closer to 10 grams per deciliter.

Q. It was actually ultimately 8 once it got down.

A. I still have never seen a sinusoidal heart rate with a hemoglobin of greater than 5.

Q. The point though, sir, is that you can get intermittent sinusoidal patterns. That is the point of the article.

A. I have certainly never seen them. If you read the text of the article, every one of them became 8 of the 10, 8 of the 10 became continuous within 160 minutes. And so again, this doesn’t really matter because in this particular case there is not loss of variability within them so it is not really relevant to whether these were or weren’t intermittent sinusoidal fetal heart rates.

Q. His conclusion, this suggests that intermittent sinusoidal fetal heart rate may occur earlier in deterioration and that a continuous sinusoidal pattern appears only in severe stress in which the fetus has lost total autonomic control. Do you disagree with that?

A. I haven’t read the entire article – and that was written in 1999 — so I don’t know that I am going to agree with a single sentence out of it.

Q. Okay. Fair enough. A tiny point, but the blood gas of 7.24, did you say that you thought it was a cord blood gas or not?

A. I thought it was obtained from an umbilical venous catheter, but it was a newborn cord gas.

Q. Well, not exactly, it was 45 minutes after they had a bunch of oxygen.

A. Actually within an hour of life is considered a newborn.

Q. And if you want to talk about your rigid criteria, you know, 11 doesn’t count but 12 does count, well, they say it has got to be cord blood gas, don’t they?

A. Yes, the article on neonatal encephalopathy does.

Q. Okay. So if you are going to be rigid now —

A. That is fine. I have no problem with my rigid self looking you, the jury, and everyone else in the eye and saying based on that I am certain beyond a reasonable medical probability that the pH was not less than 7.2 at the time the baby was delivered.

Q. Okay, that is very fine. I thank you very much. I think is all I have.

MR. MALONE: Did I miss something, Jeff? I know the jury is aching for another question from me. Thank you, sir.
Q. Doctor, you make a major part of your income every year testifying in cases like this, don’t you?
A. No. Not a major part.
Q. Is a third a major part?
A. I don’t consider it a major part, no.
Q. But the fact of the matter is, Doctor, that one third – 33 percent of your income comes from reviewing medical cases, doing depositions, and testifying in court, right?
A. One third of my income does, but the rest of it, of course, comes from my work at Yale.
Q. And that one third isn’t a major issue to you?
A. Well two thirds comes from Yale.
Q. All right. And you charge, Doctor, $500 an hour for the time that you spend reviewing records and films, true?
A. Yes, I do.
Q. And you charge $750 an hour to come and testify in court or at a deposition, don’t you?
A. No, that is incorrect. I charge $500 an hour.
Q. Have you ever testified to that, Doctor?
A. For depositions it is $750, but in Massachusetts if there are no depositions it is $500 here.
Q. Have you ever testified that you charge $750 an hour for trial as well?
A. That has not been the case for many, many years. So I can’t imagine that you have testimony to that effect. But if you do, it is very old, because that has not been the way for many years.
Q. There is a lot of testimony of yours out there, isn’t there Doctor?
A. I’m not sure.
Q. You have been doing this kind of work since 1991, right?
A. Approximately.
Q. And every year do you more and more of it, don’t you?
A. No, actually I have done considerably less in the last two years.
Q. All right. So was there a time when you actually made more than a third of your income doing this?
A. No. As I said, my average is about a third. But it has gone down in the last two years because I have been doing less.
Q. Well as recently as February you testified that it was a third of your income, right? February of this year?
A. I said on average.
Q. Do you recall testifying in a case in Maryland called Heras versus Stimpson, and you gave a deposition?
A. Let me see.
Q. Is that you, Gordon Sze?
A. Yes, that is me.
Q. And you were asked “What are your charges for review, deposition, and trial?” And you said “$500 an hour.”
Question: “For everything?”
Answer: “No. Actually for the time – the exact time of the deposition, and the exact time of the trial is 50 percent higher, and everything else is $500.”
A. Right. That’s incorrect. I charge $500 for a trial.
Q. Was that your testimony under oath, Doctor?
A. That appears to be, yes, five years ago.
Q. Mr. Pistorius, let us just carry on and take you up on your last answer. You have a good memory of what happened until the time you fired the shots?

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. And thereafter your memory is not that good.

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. When you, you’ve got your gun. You had to bend down and get it from under the bed?

A. My lady, I was on my stumps, so I was making my way to the bed as quick as I could, so I was using my hands and my legs. The gun was next to the pedestal so I had to bend down but I already was in a low position when I got my firearm and I was looking back towards the passage.

Q. You are looking back at the passage and you now, you got your gun and what did you do?

A. I turned around and I said to Reeva to get down and I made my way as quickly as I could to where the wall of the bedroom is just before the closet, the entrance of the closet.

Q. And your intention was to?

A. My intention was towards the closet, my lady.

Q. And what was your intention when you made your way to the–

A. My lady, my thought was to put myself in between the harm—to put myself between Reeva and where I thought the people were, my lady, which was in the bathroom.

Q. You see, on your version, Mr. Pistorius, if you cared about Reeva, you would have made sure that she hears you, that she’s there. You didn’t.

[A tough cross-examiner labels the witness’s story “your version.” He confronts with a flat statement that invites the witness to explain why he didn’t make sure the girlfriend heard what he says he told her. This sets up the impeachment that directly follows, based on conflicts between his two statements shortly after the shooting.]

A. I was sure that she was there, my lady, because I just spoken to her shortly before, when I got out of bed, and just before I got out of bed she spoke to me, so at that time I thought she was in the bed.

Q. That is why you changed your 1-1-5?

A. I do not know what a 1-1-5 is.

Q. That’s why, in your plea explanation you said that you spoke to her, but not in your bail application. Am I right?

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. So why did you not say that in your bail application?

[It’s okay to violate the rule against asking “why” on cross, when the cross-examiner is reasonably sure there are no good explanations. The next answer in the witness’s own words is much stronger for the cross-examiner than a one-word response to a leading question on the conflicting statements would have been.]

A. I’m not sure, my lady, I can’t explain.

Q. In your, when you prepared for court, you wanted the Court to understand that you knew she was on the bed. That’s why you invented a discussion with her.

A. I didn’t invent a discussion with her, my lady.

Q. During your bail application, you did not think that there would be a need to invent a discussion. Isn’t that so?

A. I didn’t invent any discussion that was in my bail nor that was now, my lady. I haven’t invented anything.

Q. You see, Mr. Pistorius, the nature of the discussion before you got up was such that at least you thought that she was awake.

A. I thought she was awake, and I thought that she was next to me, my lady.

Q. What I don’t understand is why you wouldn’t make sure that Reeva was fine before you storm off.

A. I’m not sure, my lady. I was in a panic and my thought was to get between the perceived danger and Reeva as quick as I could.

Q. It’s because it’s not the truth, Mr. Pistorius. That’s why it’s difficult to explain why you did not see if she was fine. Isn’t that so?

A. That is incorrect, my lady.

Q. You see in this method we had two couples give evidence. The Stipps gave evidence. The first thing that happened between them is they spoke to each other. “Did you hear that? What was that?” The same with the Johnsons. Johnson and Byrd. When something happened, they conversed. But you didn’t.

[A quick sketch of the neighbors’ testimony confronts Pistorius with the difference between his behavior and what ordinary couples sharing a bed do when they hear a strange sound in the middle of the night.]

A. I didn’t, my lady.

Q. Why?

A. I was not next to Reeva at the time, like the Johnsons and the Stipps were, and I didn’t believe that I needed to confirm what I heard.

Q. You were right next to her. You were right next to her in a situation of danger. But you did not take the time to talk to Reeva.

A. My lady, I was not right next to her when I heard the window open. I was on the other side of the bedroom.

Q. When you got your gun, you were right next to her. If she was in the room.

A. I would have been next to her then, my lady. At that point I was overcome by fear. I was wondering if the person was coming down the passage. I had to keep my eyes on the passage and I had to arm myself. I didn’t have time to think about anything else. I spoke to Reeva and I said to her, get down, call the police.

Q. I say, Mr. Pistorius, a reasonable person would have looked where Reeva was, looked if she was safe, and if she panicked. But you didn’t. You just grabbed a gun. On your own version, not my version, on your own version, you did not find out if she was OK or scared or [unintelligible]. Am I right?

A. My lady, there were a couple of questions that were put—

Q. Ok, let’s stop.

[Nel breaks down his overly long question into its component facts.]

Q. You never established if she was scared?

A. I never established if she was scared, no.

Q. You never established if she heard you?

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. If she heard the danger.

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. You wanted to arm yourself.

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. That’s the first thought that went through your mind.

A. There were many, many, many thoughts that were going through my mind at that time, my lady. I knew I had to, I knew I didn’t have any way of defending myself without my prosthetic legs on, so I ran for my firearm.

Q. That’s not true. I mean, if, if you spoke to Reeva, the two of you could have taken lots of other steps. Am I right?

A. There was no time, my lady.

[The prosecutor has obviously thought through how the witness could answer, and has a rejoinder ready.]

Q. You see, that’s what you say. You’re saying there was no time. You heard something in the bathroom. You and Reeva in the bedroom.

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. There’s a passage leading between the bedroom and the bathroom.

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. You could have done lots of other things.

A. I don’t agree, my lady.

Q. You could have, let’s agree that, arming yourself, you and her could have both gone onto the balcony?

A. In the balcony there wouldn’t have been any way of escaping if we had got cornered, my lady. We wouldn’t be able to move anywhere.

Q. But it is a possibility?

A. It’s a possibility, my lady.

Q. You could have both hid behind the bed.

A. That’s a possibility, my lady.

Q. You both could’ve been on her side of the bed, with your view on the passage.

A. My lady, I didn’t want harm to come to Reeva so I wanted to put myself as I said between the harm and Reeva. If I had stuck next to Reeva it would have put her in harm, my lady so I didn’t think of it. I told her to get down and call the police. I could have done a host of things but at that time it was a decision that I made.

Q. You see, Mister, you know it’s my view that your version is not correct. And it’s improbable that you would act in that way but let’s take it one step further. When you armed yourself, you rushed towards the area of the passage?

A. I rushed towards where the passage and the bedroom meet, my lady, just before you enter the passage.

Q. And then you entered the passage?

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. Ready to shoot.

A. That’s incorrect, my lady.

Q. What, then? Were you not ready to shoot?

A. I was not ready to shoot, my lady, at any point was I ready to shoot. I was trying to see what was happening in my home.

Q. But why would you go, arm yourself, rush toward the danger, if you’re not ready to shoot? That’s not true. Not on your version, either.

A. My lady, I didn’t have time to think. I was dealt with the situation in which I had to protect Reeva and I had to protect myself.

Q. It’s not that easy. You cannot tell the court I didn’t think. You armed yourself and I am sure you released the safety mechanism on your gun.

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. So you did that. You got your gun, released the safety mechanism. Why?

A. So that if I needed to use my firearm I could protect myself.

Q. And that’s why you stormed. You wanted to shoot.

A. We’re talking about two separate times in the evening. I didn’t storm to the bathroom, my lady. I ran to get to where the passage began and then I walked extremely slowly and cautiously until I got to just before the corner where the bathroom passage is.

Q. Ready to shoot, if you saw something you would have just pulled the trigger. Am I wrong?

A. I am not sure, my lady.

Q. No, but what was your intention? I’m walking down the passage. I want to protect Reeva. You would have fired a shot.

A. My intention was to protect Reeva and to protect myself.

Q. And if you saw somebody?

A. I’m not sure, my lady.

Q. What were you ready to do?

A. I wasn’t ready for anything, my lady.

Q. You were. You armed yourself. You’re ready to shoot.

A. As I said, my lady, I didn’t want to take anybody’s life. I screamed at the intruders to get out of my home.

[When the witness doesn’t answer the question, the prosecutor brings him right back.]

Q. You see again, Mr. Pistorius, you say I wasn’t ready to take somebody’s life, you’re arguing. Just think of the questions. Walking down the passage, you had your gun. The safety was disengaged. You were ready to shoot.

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. You wanted to shoot. If you saw somebody you wanted to shoot.

A. There’s a massive difference between being ready to deal with the confrontation in that manner, in that situation, in the limited time, my lady, and wanting to shoot someone. There’s a massive difference between those two.

Q. The difference is that you were ready to shoot. If somebody moved you would have fired?

A. That’s not the difference, my lady. That’s the point that I said yes to. The point was that I don’t agree that I wanted to shoot someone.

Q. If you saw somebody in that passage, what then?

A. I would have to defend myself, my lady. As I said, I cannot engage in a physical altercation if I don’t have prosthetic legs on.

Q. Walking down the passage, gun in hand, if you saw somebody, you would have fired?

A. I am not sure, my lady. That’s not the situation that I was dealt with.

Q. But remember, you remember so much detail. You know when you walked slow. You know when you walked a bit faster. You know when you walked really fast. Now I’m asking you to tell the court, when you walked down that passage, the gun was pointing towards the bathroom.

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. Any movement, you would have fired.

A. My lady, I remember facts, and I remember things about the truth. I am not sure what I would have done in a hypothetical environment.

Q. And then you started screaming?

A. No, I started screaming before that point, my lady.

Q. Oh. Tell me then, at what point—you see, it’s interesting. You remember the detail so well that you correct me. And I just want you to remember. Now, when did you start screaming?

A. I started shouting and screaming, my lady, as I entered the passage way.

Q. What did you shout and scream?

A. I screamed for the persons to get out of my house. I screamed for Reeva to phone the police. I repeated that several times.

Q. And there was no response from Reeva?

A. No, there was no response from Reeva, my lady.

Q. At that time your intention is to go towards the danger.

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. You’re vulnerable, but you go towards the danger?

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. Why would you do that?

A. Because if I had stayed where I was, my lady, Reeva and I would be in danger.

Q. Nobody would have been in danger because there was no intruder. That’s the fact of this matter.

A. I didn’t know that at the time, my lady.

Q. I know that’s what you’re trying to say but the fact of this matter is that if you had stayed in that room, Reeva would have been alive. Those are the facts. I’m testing you on a version that’s not true.

A. That’s not a test, my lady, that’s a hypothetical version, that if I had stayed in my room, no life would have been lost that night. I understand that. I agree with that. But that’s not a test.

Q. You see my problem is the following. You said you were vulnerable. You felt vulnerable. Am I right?

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. But you approached the danger. The two doesn’t make sense. You can’t be vulnerable and approach the danger.

A. My lady, if I had stayed where I was anything could have happened. We hear every day about how people are caught in their house or mace sprayed or shot at. If I had stayed in my room and somebody came down and they tried to shoot at me somebody could have shot Reeva. I they had come in my room and they sprayed mace in my room, something could’ve happened.
I wanted to put distance as much distance as I could between Reeva and what I had perceived to be the danger

Q. Reeva was the one person that you didn’t even talk to. So you can’t bring her into this. You didn’t even talk to her.

A. That isn’t correct, my lady.

Q. Well, there wasn’t a conversation. Let me rephrase that. I’m sorry. You didn’t even make sure that she was there, and that she heard you before you left.

A. I didn’t make sure. I was sure at that time that she was. I didn’t make sure, my lady, that is correct.

[This next question would be objectionable as phrased in an American court, since the prosecutor seems to assert his personal disbelief in the witness’s story.]
Q. What I don’t understand, Mr. Pistorius, is, and I’m just testing your version, because as far as I’m concerned, it’s not true. If you had remained in your bedroom you had a clear view of the passage.

A. That is correct, my lady. If I had stood in a certain place in my room, I would have. If I had hid behind the bed I wouldn’t have had a clear view.

Q. But, right around the corner you could peep down the passage with a clear view of the bed.

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. So that would put you in a position where somebody coming out of the bathroom had to walk at least 5 meters to get to you.

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. And you would be able to see them.

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. But you rushed towards the danger.

A. I didn’t rush towards the danger, my lady, that’s incorrect.

Q. You walked towards the danger.

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. Why would you do that?

[Another “why” question works because it is narrowly focused on an apparent contradiction.]

A. I’m not sure, my lady. As I said at that point I was trying to get myself and Reeva as far away from the danger as possible.

Q. You know, when you just said, “I’m not sure,” that indicates the probability of your version, because nobody would be sure why you did it. It doesn’t make sense.

A. I don’t agree, my lady.

Q. And you agree by saying, “I’m not sure.” I’m not sure why I did it.

A. I’m not sure, my lady, I didn’t have any time. That was my instinct that told me to do it. I’m not sure why.

Q. You see, I find your instinct strange. I find your instinct strange for the following two reasons. One, instinct would have made sure Reeva is safe. That was never instinct, to make sure she’s safe. Am I right?

A. My lady, I think everybody’s instinct is different. That’s why it’s instinct, my lady.

Q. So, your instinct wasn’t to make sure she’s safe.

A. I thought that she was safe, and in the process of what I did I was thinking that I was making it safer.

Q. We will go through this. You gave the court unbelievable detail about thought processes in your evidence. Where you walked slowly, where you walked faster, where you shouted. And I’m testing your thought processes because you put yourself out there.

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. Why did you approach the danger?

A. Because I wanted to put myself between the harm, the perceived danger, the threat , the people that I thought were in my home. I didn’t want to bring that upon Reeva. I was in my room. There were a number of things that could have happened.

Q. And you and Reeva could have gone out the main bedroom door.

[The prosecutor refers to the door leading from the bedroom suite to the rest of the house.]

A. Could have, my lady.

Q. Why did you not do that?

A. I’m not sure, my lady.

Q. That is the one thing in this case, Mr. Pistorius, that you cannot explain. Not on your version. Why did you not leave through your bedroom door?

A: My lady, I have very, very limited mobility on my stumps on a hard surface like tiles.

Q. Is that your reason why you did not leave through the main bedroom door?

A. My lady, I am not sure.

Q. Then give us a reason. You went past the bedroom door. You two could have left through that main bedroom door to safety.

A. My lady, it’s easy to now look back and talk about all the possibilities but it’s not what happened in the time that I had that evening.

[When the witness doesn’t answer the question about the easy escape route, the cross-examiner rephrases the same question, echoing the witness’s use of the word “easy.”]

Q. It’s easy to think of a version why you killed Reeva and to come up with an innocent reason, that’s also easy. But the defects are that the door, the bedroom door, was the closest escape there was.

A. My lady, I haven’t come up with a version. This is the same version I had in my bail. The state’s case has changed many times, my lady. My version has stayed the same. I didn’t come up with the version. I didn’t even know the facts. I was only handed the docket last year in August with all the facts. Yet my version hasn’t changed. Yes, granted, I could have gone onto the balcony. I could have left the room. But that isn’t what happened.

Q. Mr. Pistorius, you have to come up with a version to put Reeva in the bathroom to explain why you went to the bathroom. Your whole version is to explain why you got to the bathroom innocently. That’s why the one major issue of the bedroom door you cannot explain. Explain that. You have to tell the court why you didn’t take Reeva out that bedroom window to safety—out the bedroom door.

A. I don’t know why I didn’t do that, my lady.

Q. You see, you did the opposite. You approached the danger. That doesn’t make sense. It’s not true.

A. My lady, If you listen to Miss Taylor’s evidence, where she said that when there was an intruder I went downstairs and I looked, that’s my personality, my lady. That is how I am. So instead of cowering and running away at that split moment I wanted to put myself between the danger, perceived danger, and Reeva, my lady. I don’t, I can’t explain. I wish I did. I wish I did all these other things that are put to me.

[In a nice bit here, the prosecutor becomes the witness for a short series of statement questions.]

Q. So you wanted to go confront them, that’s me, Oscar. I wanted to go confront them?

A. That is correct.

Q. Stand up for myself.

A. That’s correct, my lady.

Q. If I see them I’ll shoot them.

A. That’s not what I said, my lady.

Q. But isn’t that the inference? I wanted to go confront these robbers.

A. That’s correct, my lady.

Q. And you did, by firing.

A. That’s correct, my lady.

Q. You walked down the passage, your intention is to go confront the intruders.

A. My intention was not to confront them. If you remember what I said it was that I was shouting for them to get out of my house. I didn’t want a confrontation.

Q. Now if that is true, finish up now, I’ll give you an opportunity—

A. But I was aware, my lady, more terrified, that maybe these people weren’t there to leave, if I was shouting at them. That’s why when I got to the entrance to the bathroom as I said I stopped shouting because I wasn’t sure if they’d left the house or not.

Q. Now you see, let us just take it slowly, you knew your bathroom very well. You know what it looked like, how big the toilet is, in the bathroom, how where the shower is, you knew it well, am I right?

A. Of course, my lady, it’s my house.

Q. You knew the only way into your house through the bathroom is down that passage? From the bathroom [bedroom]?

A. If one hadn’t obtained means through the window then that is correct, my lady.

Q. If you’re in the bathroom, to get from the bathroom to the house, the only way to do that is to walk down the– .

Judge: To the bedroom.

A. The bathroom’s in the house, my lady.

Judge: To the bedroom.

Q. Yes.

A. I don’t understand that question, I’m sorry my lady.

Q. Let me try again. For an intruder that gained entry through your bathroom, if you take that as a fact, to get to your bedroom he must walk down the passage.

A. That’s correct, my lady.

Q. That is the passage that you could control from your bedroom?

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. But you didn’t.

[A short plain statement confronting the witness with his inconsistencies often works best.]

A. I didn’t, my lady, I’ve said that before.

Q. When you shouted and screamed you said you shouted for them to leave and for Reeva to phone the police.

A. That’s correct, my lady.

Q. You got no response from Reeva?

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. Now, do you think…do you think it was loud, the screams?

A. The shouts and screams, my lady, were very loud. I was shouting and I was screaming and they were very loud. I was shouting at the people to get out.

Q. Shouting at Reeva?

A. And I was shouting at Reeva. I shouted at her in the beginning to get down and phone the police, and as I was progressing up the passage I was shouting for the people to get out, I was shouting get out.

Q. And she never responded?

A. My lady, this is the fourth time I’ve said she never responded.

Q. And I’ll ask it more. She never responded?

A. No, my lady, she never responded.

Q. Then you got to the entrance of the bathroom?

A. That’s correct, my lady.

Q. And you kept quiet?

A. That’s correct, my lady.

Q. The reason being?

A. I didn’t want to give my position away. I was scared that the person was around the corner. I knelt down. I was holding the cupboard. I had my firearm in front of me. And I was worried that the person was waiting there to ambush me, my lady. I wanted to peer around the corner.

Q. Okay, so this wasn’t split second. Now we’re thinking, now you’re thinking, and you are kneeling down and your gun is facing towards the bathroom?

A. Everything about that event was split decision, my lady. Every moment there was a difference in something that could have happened. What I was in the passage it was that the person would have been a little further in proximity, that they could have stuck their hand around the wall and fired at me. When I got to the entrance of the passage it was a different situation. Somebody could have attacked me with a firearm or they could have just run up to me and choked me, my lady.

Q. That’s why it doesn’t make sense that you approached them. You’re right. Thinking of your version that’s true, but you approached them.

A. That’s correct, my lady.

Q. That is not true Mr. Pistorius, nobody would do that. Nobody would do that. It’s a lie.

A. It’s incorrect, my lady.

Q. Just before you get to the far area of the bathroom what happened then?

[The cross-examiner asks a direct-exam style question to get the witness’s story out, for further dissection.]

A. I looked around the corner to see that there was no one in the bathroom or that there was no one around the corner. I then proceeded. I kept my distance as far away from the wall as far as possible. So I didn’t follow an arc, I walked all the way down the closet to the last cupboard so I could see the angle as much as I could with the wall that goes from the closet into the bathroom. When I couldn’t see anybody there, then I slowly moved forward along the carpet until the point where the tiles begin at the entrance of the bathroom.

Q. Yes? Then?

A. At that point I did pretty much the same as I had done when I reached the corner from the closet into the passage of the bathroom. Again, I wasn’t sure if there was somebody against the basin that was going to be there. As I went sure I saw the window was open, I wasn’t sure if the persons were standing on the ladder, if they just had opened the door, or if there was somebody inside the toilet at that point. I heard the door slam earlier so I wasn’t sure where the people or persons were.

Q. No, no, wait, you’re going too quickly now. We’re going way too quickly now. I just want to get the sequence. You, in that passage, you screamed and shouted.

A. That’s correct, my lady.

Q. Then, close to the entrance where the tiles start, that’s where you kept quiet.

A. Are we talking about what I’m doing now, my lady?

Q. Yeah, what you were doing.

A. Yes, then I kept quiet, my lady.

Q. When did you hear a door shut?

A. While I was in the passage, my lady, just before I entered the bathroom.

Q. So it was in the passage. You heard a door slam.

A. That’s correct, my lady.

Q. And the only door that could be could have been the toilet?

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. So what did you think?

A. I thought that either there was somebody going into the toilet or that somebody had kicked the door, because the door opens up to near where the window—one of the windows—I didn’t know yet at that point which window it was that was open. So I knew that the door was in that way. So because I was screaming, “Get out of my house,” I was hoping that the person was fleeing the house and in the process had kicked the door closed. So I wasn’t sure at that point whether there was someone in the toilet, but I was 100% sure that there was someone in the bathroom that had accessed the window and climbed into my house.

Q. That long argument of 100% sure, that’s what you thought, because it never happened. There was nobody that had accessed that window on that night.

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. Now, when you entered the bathroom you said you saw that the window was open.

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. So there was enough light for you to see the window.

A. There wasn’t enough light. There was lights outside the window. There was streetlights and house lights.

Q. But why did you say there wasn’t enough light and then you said there were?

A. My lady, here were lights on outside, there was ambient light that was shining in. The bathroom wasn’t as dark as the bedroom. In the bedroom there was no lights. In the bathroom there was limited light.

Q. Ok, now, you saw that the window was open. What happened then?

A. I then stood at that point and I peered into the bathroom, my lady to see that there wasn’t anybody around the corner. Again I was a very low position, with my hand against the wall for balance. I peered around the corner to where the basins are and I didn’t see anyone there, my lady, and I walked back a step or two.

Q. But, before we go on, you, one thing we know is at that stage you looked in the bathroom and you were clear in your mind that there was no one in the bathroom.

A. In the bathroom, lady, yes, that’s true.

Q. That you established. There’s no one in the bathroom. And you saw that the toilet door was closed?

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. You could see that.

A. Yes, I could see the toilet door was closed, my lady.

Q. Now, that door was usually open? Or not?

A. I beg your pardon?

Q. The toilet door, was that usually open? Or not?

A. Yes, it’s usually open, my lady.

Q. Was that strange that it was closed? Or did that not make a difference?

A. It wasn’t strange at all, my lady. I heard it slammed close. It wasn’t strange at all.

Q. You either heard someone kick the door or slam it close, but the fact that it was closed, was that, in itself, strange?

A. I never, ever said I heard somebody kick the door, my lady. I said I heard the door slam close.

Q. You know, you said so. You said one of two things. Either it was slammed closed or somebody kicked the door.

A. And in fleeing the house, that’s correct. I’m sorry, my lady.

Q. Well, you see, why are you making these mistakes? Because the fact that you’re making them is significant. Why are you making this mistake?

A. The last question to me, my lady, was it strange that the door was open or closed. For me it wasn’t strange that it was closed because I heard it slamming. Whether it was kicked closed or pulled it was slammed closed, my lady.

Q. Mr. Pistorius, you said, “I never, ever said that somebody kicked the door.”

A. I apologize, my lady.

Q. You see, you can’t just make mis—give contradictory versions and then apologize. There’s a reason for it. What is the reason why you are doing it?

A. I made a mistake, my lady.

[The cross-examiner asserts that no one telling a truthful story could have forgotten that he had just given a detail a few minutes before that he then contradicted.]

Q. No, it can’t be a mistake. It must be I am thinking of something that never happened and I have to keep up. That’s it. Your version never happened and you have to keep up with an untruth. That’s why you’re making these mistakes. Isn’t that so?

A. I made a mistake, my lady.

Q. Why would you make a mistake about somebody kicking the door? I want to know why?

A. I’m not sure, my lady.

Q. You have to be sure. You made it.

A. If I were sure, my lady, I wouldn’t have made the mistake in the first place.

Q. No.

A. So I apologize, and I don’t know why I said that. In the time I was in the passage the question that was posed to me was different to what the situation was when I said the door was slammed, was it strange for me that the door was closed. And I had heard the door slam. I had forgotten about that point and I apologized for it, my lady. I can’t explain why I forgot.

Q. OK, one more time then I’m moving on. It’s not the mistake. It’s you saying, “I never, ever said somebody kicked the door.” That is, for me, what it’s about, not the fact that you made a mistake. That you were so convinced that you never said it.

A. I understand, my lady.

Q. As convinced as you are about the rest of your evidence, that is my problem.

A. My lady, I have pointed out that I’m sorry, that I understand that I made a mistake.

[The prosecutor now invites the witness to comment on his own demeanor.]

Q. I am putting it to you that your mistakes are as convincing as your evidence in the way you deliver it. And that’s a problem. Do you want to comment on it?

A. No, my lady.

Q. Now the door is closed, you know how big that door is inside? How small it is?

A. I know the size of the toilet more or less, my lady.

Q. It has been re-constructed here, that’s on scale. That’s exactly how big the toilet is behind me.

A. That’s correct, if it’s on scale, that’s correct. It doesn’t mean that I know how big that toilet is or how big this toilet is, my lady. I know about the size it is but I don’t know the measurements of the toilet.

Q. But you know that if someone’s there they’ve got limited space to move, is that right?

A. That’s correct, my lady.

A. For them to get out, if they wanted to get out of the toilet any which way, what would they be able to do?

A. They’d be able to climb out the window, or they’d be able to come out the door if they had a ladder, my lady.

Q. If there’s a ladder at the window they could go down a ladder if they get through the window.

A. That’s correct, my lady.

Q. Or come through the door.

A. That’s correct, my lady.

Q. Now, I have to test you on this. You want to tell the Court that you reasonably thought an intruder came through your window and walked into your toilet and close the door? Why would an intruder do that? Is that what you thought?

A. I’m sorry, my lady, would he somehow rephrase this question?

Q. Are you saying that it’s reasonable for any person to think that an intruder would come through the window into the toilet and close the door?

A. He’s now asking me what would be reasonable for an intruder breaking into a house, my lady.

Q. If there was an intruder, do you think he would go into a toilet and close the door?

A. I’m not sure what an intruder would do, my lady, if he was caught off guard. I don’t know how I’m expected to answer that question.

Q. Now you’re standing there, you, Mr. Oscar Pistorius standing there, thinking he came through that window, he went into that toilet. That’s what you thought.

A. That’s correct, this was a possibility, my lady.

Q. No, it is so far fetched that it would happen, Mr. Pistorius. It’s improbable that you would even think that an intruder would run into my toilet and lock the door. And close it.

A. I didn’t think I have mentioned the locking of any door, my lady. What I heard was the door slam. So it had to be, if I was in a position where I’d have to consider what had happened with the noises I heard, I had to consider that there was someone in the toilet or that there was somebody on the ladder.

Q. I just want to consider. Let us use that word. You know what you considered? You considered where you had to walk slowly where you had to be quiet. You had to consider to walk slowly beyond the passage, keeping your attention to the danger.

A. That’s correct, my lady.

Q. You had to consider when to be quiet.

A. My lady, I don’t know if that was consideration or if it was just instinct that told me it would be stupid to make a noise at a certain time.

Q. But considering as far as—

A. Considering has a time component to it, my lady, which I didn’t have the luxury of.

Q. You want to say that. We are testing it. Time, time, time is something that you’ve said and we are testing it.

A. That’s correct, my lady.

Q. Just listen to my questions. You’ve considered that it’s now time to be quiet. It’s something that you considered and followed. And did. Am I right?

A. Consideration, as I said, my lady, takes time to reason. When I was standing at the bathroom, looking at the door and at the window, I was shouting at that point. There wasn’t time to consider. I was thinking, is the person on the ladder? Is the person in the bathroom? It was a thought that happened.

Q. You had to consider and reason to be quiet. I know you want to give your version. And we’ll get there. You considered and you reasoned that it’s now time to be quiet.

A. I never said that, my lady.

Q. I asked you what, exactly. We’re testing your thought methods. Because if you want to say, now, we’re testing your thought methods, so just follow me.

A. I don’t follow, my lady, what he’s asking.

Q. I’ll try. You thought that it’s better to be quiet when you got to the tiled area of the bathroom.

A. That’s correct, my lady.

Q. And you thought it’s better to be quiet why?

A. Because I didn’t want to give my position away, my lady.

Q. Then you thought I must be careful when I go into the bathroom? Am I right?

A. The whole time I was thinking that I need to be careful, my lady. My life was in danger, so the entire time I thought that I needed to be careful.

Q. And you thought, make sure there’s nobody in the bathroom, and you did. There’s nobody there.

A. I don’t think that thought crossed my mind, that I must make sure there was no one in the bathroom, I don’t remember saying that, my lady.

Q. Or to make sure there is someone I have to shoot at, but something I have to do when you got to the bathroom.

A. My lady, I don’t think that’s a fair comment, my lady. I never said that I went there to shoot someone.

Q. Now, if you did not go there to shoot someone, what did you want to do then?

A. I wanted to make the person that was in the house flee, my lady. Get away from the danger, causing danger to myself and to Reeva, my lady.

Q. OK, let us just work on that. You intention was to make the person flee?

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. Nothing else.

A. That’s correct, my lady.

Q. And when you got into the bathroom, there was nobody there.

A. That is correct, my lady.

Q. What happened then?

A. And then I stood at the point where I had moved back to. After I had looked in the basin I had stood back so that just the bathroom door was in line with the wall. And I could see the window and I had my firearm still in front of me. Again I screamed for Reeva to phone security or police. And then I shouted and I kept on shouting.

Q. Just one moment. Of your whole version, Mr. Pistorius, this is the most improbable. Reeva at that stage is 3 meters away from you in the toilet?

A. I didn’t know that, my lady, I thought she was in the bedroom.

Q. No, no. In fact, I’m talking about the facts, at that stage, when you shouted and screamed for Reeva to phone the police, she is 3 meters away from you in a toilet.

A. That’s correct, my lady.

Q. And she never uttered a word.

A. That’s correct, my lady.

Q. It’s not possible. It’s not probable. She would be scared. She would shout out and talk to you. You are in the same room.

A. My lady, I agree with Mr. Nel. She would have been terrified, my lady. But I don’t think that would have led her to scream out. I think she would have kept quiet for that reason. I was shouting and I was approaching the toilet. And she was in the—as I was approaching the bathroom, she was in the toilet. Then I would presume that she would think that the danger was coming closer to her. So why would she shout out?

Q. Because you’re in the room, sir. Mr. Pistorius, you’re now in the room, you’re shouting, she’s 3 meters away from you behind that particular door. There is no way that you’ll convince a court that she stood there saying nothing. Why? Why would she not say a thing?

A. I don’t know, my lady.

Q. It is not true. The only reason is that it’s not true, Mr. Pistorius. She would have responded.

A. Is that a question, my lady?

Q. Yes.

A. That’s not true, my lady.

Q. You see, and we’ll take it through, I see there’s 15 minutes left, in fact she is standing, on your version and on the state’s version, she’s standing facing behind the door facing the bathroom, facing you that’s shouting.

A. That’s correct, my lady.

Q. Now if she was scared she would have not have been there. She would have hid somewhere in the toilet.

A. I can’t say what she would have done. I don’t think anyone could say what she would have done, Mr. Nel.

Q. I can, Mr. Pistorius, I think the state can. She was talking to you, she was standing right in front of you by the toilet door talking to you when you shot her.

A. That is not true, my lady.

Q. That’s the only reasonable explanation for her standing upright. That’s the only reasonable explanation why you shot her in the head. The way you did.

A. That is not true, my lady.

Q. She wasn’t scared of anything. Except you. She wasn’t scared of an intruder. She was scared of you.

A. That is not true, my lady.

Q. Mr. Pistorius, on the probabilities, I am looking at the door, you don’t have to. If bullet hole A hit her on the right hand side, in her right hip, she’s standing facing you.

A. I don’t dispute that, my lady.

Q. Now if she was scared, if your version was true, she would not have been in front of the door facing you.

A. As I said my lady, I don’t think anyone could say where she would’ve stood if she was thinking that I was—in her mind, it must have been that I was retreating to the bathroom. In her mind I must have been retreating, screaming, “Reeva, phone the police!” Screaming for the people to get out. If she was in the toilet then she would have been quiet. I don’t see why she would have screamed out.

Q. If she thought you were retreating, that gives her more reason to talk. To say, you’re coming to me, come, I’ll phone the police. What’s wrong, Oscar? Never.

A. My lady, she had been involved in a similar incident before in her life, where she had locked herself away. From my understanding she wasn’t able to speak to people for a day or so afterwards, my lady, so I don’t think that is the case.

Q. You see, Mr. Pistorius, she’s awake, she’s in a toilet, you’re shouting, you are screaming. You are 3 meters from her, she would have responded. She would not have been quiet, Mr. Pistorius.

A. She didn’t respond, my lady.

Q. Did she scream at all whilst you shot her four times?

A. No, my lady.

[The defendant’s story defies what most people would think. So the prosecutor stretches the point by asking it again.]

Q. Are you sure? Are you sure, Mr. Pistorius, that Reeva did not scream after the first shot? Are you, Mr. Pistorius?

[Long pause.]

Q. My lady, I am giving the witness time to console himself. He’s distressed. I’ll wait a minute.

A. My lady, at no point did Reeva shout out or scream. I wish she let me know she was there. She did not do that.

Q. Just answer my question. After the first shot, did she scream?

A. No, my lady.

Q. Are you sure?

A. Yes, my lady.

Q. Would you have heard her?

A. I don’t think I would have heard her over the gunshot, my lady. My ears were ringing.

Q. That’s why I’m asking you the question. How can you exclude the fact she was screaming if you couldn’t hear?

A. If I couldn’t hear then I couldn’t hear it, my lady.

Q. No, you said, Mr. Pistorius, she never screamed. You couldn’t hear. You’re just saying that.

A. That is what I’m saying, my lady.

Q. No, that’s not what you’re saying. You’re saying she didn’t scream. And that’s why I tested you on it.

A. My lady, the sound of the gunshots in the bathroom, you wouldn’t have heard anyone scream. The decibels of the gunshot, I don’t think you would have heard anyone scream. When I had finished firing the gunshots, I was screaming. I couldn’t hear my own voice.

Q. You see, that’s why I’m asking you the questions. People heard a woman scream during the shots. Is that possible?

A. No, that’s not possible, my lady.

Q. Why?

A. Because a woman didn’t scream at any point, my lady.

Q. No, you can’t say that.

A. That’s my version, my lady.

Q. No you can’t. That’s your version, but that’s not something that you can with conviction say to the Court, that nobody screamed, during the shots. Can you?

A. Yes, I can, my lady.

Q. No you can’t. How can you? You just said you can’t. How can you say that nobody screamed during the shots?

A. I can’t say that no one screamed during the shots. I can say no one screamed, my lady. There wasn’t a woman screaming.

Q. How can you say that? How can you say that?

A. Because I was there, Mr. Nel. I didn’t hear anyone–

Q. I think you’re making a mistake again. The mistake is you forgot about your ears ringing.

A. I’m not talking about the shooting, my lady, I am talking about the entire evening.

Q. No, I’m talking about the shooting. You can’t get away with that every time. You don’t know what I’m talking about. Sometimes you have to take responsibility. I said during the shooting, Mr. Pistorius. You cannot have understood me wrongly.

A. I agreed with Mr. Nel when he made that point, my lady. And then he went on to talk about people heard screaming.

Q. During the shots, Mr. Pistorius, you cannot get away with this time and time again, pretending that you couldn’t follow.

A. I didn’t pretend I didn’t follow. I agreed with Mr. Nel, my lady.

Q. Now let’s—it’s on record and I’ll argue it. Can you say that Reeva didn’t scream after the first shot?

A. I didn’t hear a scream after the first shot, my lady. My ears were ringing.

Q. You know what, it was put in in your bail application that nobody but you screamed on that night.

A. That’s correct, my lady.

Roux: My lady, I think, in all fairness, Mr. Nel just put when he’s talking about, because there’s a great deal of difference between defense and the state of when the screaming would have been, when the shots would’ve been fired. Because what I put was far in relation to when the state is saying the shots were, and I don’t want to put something in the mouth of anyone. But Mr. Nel, let’s just make that clear, because we’re not talking about the same time, my lady—

Judge: You’re also referring to the bail application:

Roux: Absolutely, my lady. Absolutely. So we’re talking about different times and that’s my concern. Just being made clear.

Nel: My lady, it cannot be, I referred to the bail application. The bail application, my lady, it’s one of those embarrassing things. When you need the bail application, it’s not here. But—

Judge: Well, it might be a good idea to point it from the record so that we know exactly what you’re talking about.

Q. Look at it, the way I remember it is that there was no woman screaming. That was what was put in the bail application. I’ve marked it on mine, my lady. I’ll carry on on this when we get back and I have the record. I will do that.

Judge: Yes.

Q. Mr. Pistorius, now you see, I’ve heard your evidence on how it affected you and how you felt. Will you agree with me that for Reeva being in that small cubicle, when four shots were fired through the door, must have been horrific.

A. I agree, my lady.

Q. For Reeva, being in that small cubicle when four shots were fired through the door, must have been horrific.

A. I agree, my lady.

Q. What happened to her that night was unthinkable. I never heard you say anything about how she must have reacted in that toilet. Thinking of it. Because that’s the crux of this case. Have you?

A. Yes, I have thought about it many, many times, my lady. In my own answering of the question I explained what Reeva must have thought when I was walking back. I’m haunted many times by what she probably thought in the last moments that she lived. Many, many times.

Q. Let us deal with it, you are standing in the bathroom, you’re now shouting and screaming at Reeva, what happened?

A. Are we talking about after the shooting?

Q. No, before the shooting.

A. At that point, my lady, I was standing in the bathroom with my firearm pointed toward the door, with my eyes going between the open window and the door. And I heard a noise from inside the toilet.

Q. What noise?

A. It sounded like wood, my lady, like wood moving.

Q. Wood moving?

A. That’s correct my lady.

Q. Is that all you heard? Wood moving?

A. I thought I heard the door opening, my lady.

Q. No, you see, there we go. There we go. Not once did you say I heard the door open. It’s the first word today that you would say. I heard the door. You perceived lots of things. But it’s not in the record that you heard the door opening. Why now today?

A. I didn’t say that I heard the door opening, my lady.

Q. What did you hear?

A. I said I thought that I heard the door opening. That’s perception.

Q. You thought you heard the door opening. But did you also think you heard wood moving?

A. Yes, that’s correct. I thought I heard the noise of wood moving, that doorframe, my lady, doesn’t fit the door properly. When you open it it makes a knocking noise. That’s what I’d thought I’d heard.

Q. You stood there, and you had your eyes on the door. And the window.

A. That’s correct, my lady.

Q. But you pointed the gun at the door.

A. Yes, the firearm was pointed towards the door, my lady.

Q. What happened then?

A. I discharged the firearm, my lady.

Q. But first you thought you heard something. What did you hear?

A. I heard a noise from inside the bathroom, my lady, and I thought or perceived that someone was coming out to attack me.

Q. You heard a noise and you thought, somebody is coming out to attack me. Nothing else.

A. Nothing else, my lady.

Q. But, thinking back, that could have been anything. Why would you think someone is coming out to attack you?

A. That’s what I thought at the time.

Q. That’s a lie, Mr. Pistorius.

A. I didn’t have the luxury to think back—

Q. No, you do. You standing there. You facing the door. Why would you think somebody was attacking you?

A. Because I heard a noise coming out—

Q. You see, the hearing of a noise and the perception of an attack is two different things. Why do you think somebody wanted to attack you?

A. Because I heard a noise coming from inside the toilet, my lady. I perceived that. I thought that was the sound of the door opening.

Q. No, you see, the two doesn’t make sense. The fact that you hear a noise, and the fact that you think the door was opening, those two is not the same thing. It is not the same thing. And your perception is impossible, Mr. Pistorius. You never perceived somebody coming after you. Am I right?

A. You are incorrect, my lady.

Q. In fact you knew that Reeva was behind the door. And you shot at her. That is the only thing that makes sense. You shot at her, knowing that she’s behind that door.

A. It’s not true, my lady.

Closing Comments by Malone:
The court then adjourned for the day. Pistorius was to face two more days of Nel’s relentless questions. Although not included in this excerpt because of space limits, Nel structured his cross to link the end to the beginning. Near the start, showing impatience at Pistorius’s repeated euphemism, “I made a terrible mistake,” the prosecutor said, “You killed her. You shot and killed her. Won’t you take responsibility for that?” Then in a moment that had spectators gasping, he showed a photo of the victim’s bloodied head and demanded: ““That’s it — have a look, Mr. Pistorius. I know you don’t want to, because you don’t want to take responsibility, but it’s time that you look at it. Take responsibility for what you’ve done, Mr. Pistorius.” Five days later, he ended the cross-examination by inviting Pistorius to take the blame for shooting his girlfriend. Then, when Pistorius veered away from a direct response, the prosecutor asked: “We should blame somebody. Should we blame Reeva? She never told you she was going to the toilet.” To Pistorius’s meek, “No, my lady,” Nels responded: “Should we blame the government?” When Pistorius responded with another reference to a perceived intruder in the toilet, Nel asked: “Who should we blame for the Black Talon rounds that ripped through her body?”
Q Doctor Andrews, we know each other, is that correct?

A We have met before.

Q I want to first start off with the financial information that Mr. Peake concentrated on in this case. The medical legal work that you were discussing with Mr. Peake, that does not involve people who you actually treat, correct?

A No, these are not my patients. These are people whose records that I’m asked to read that I am not treating.

Q And the medical legal work that you do as well as the record review that you discussed with Mr. Peake, you have set up a corporation to handle that, correct?

A I have.

Q And that corporation is William C. Andrews, Jr., MD, PC, correct?

A That is correct.

Q And that is the corporation that receives all of the proceeds from your medical legal expert work and your records review and all your non-treating doctor stuff, correct?

A Correct.

Q And you said, if I recall, Mr. Peake asked what you made in 2012, last year, from doing expert witness and record reviews and you said it was $340,000, correct?

A That’s correct.

Q Now, that is just profit, correct?

A That is correct.

Q Because your corporation made much more than that in 2012 for your legal expert witness work as well as your record reviews, is that correct?

A That is correct.

Q Tell us, if you would, how much money did your corporation make in 2012 for this stuff?

A I didn’t look that up last night. I think it made around $500,000.

Q So a half million dollars?

A Correct.

Q Now, in 2011 when you told Mr. Peake that you made $288,000. That, again, was profit from these things, correct?

A Correct.

Q Again, that does not include all the money that your corporation made for what you did, correct?

A Right.

Q Now, Doctor Andrews, tell us how much did your corporation make in 2011 for the work that you do? Again, this is not treating work. This is not your clinical practice. Just the legal expert work and the medical reviews.

A And, again, I did not look it up but I think you can do the math and say probably somewhere around $425,000.

Q And then in 2010, again, when Mr. Peake asked you what you made and you said a quarter of a million dollars, that again was just profit, correct?

A That is correct.

Q Tell us how much your corporation made in 2010 from the proceeds of the work that you do like here today?

A Again, an estimate would be around $400,000.

Q And then you were predicting this year up through this time you have made around $300,000. Again, that would be profit?

A That’s my prediction for the year.

Q And that would be profit, correct?

A That is correct.

Q So how much are you expecting that your corporation will make this year from your proceeds of doing work like this?

A And an estimate would be about $450,000.

Q And then in 2009 –did you look at your 2009 tax returns for you and your corporation?

A I do not.

Q Do you recall in 2009 making a profit of a quarter of a million dollars?

A I really don’t. I haven’t looked back at that.

Q Do you have any reason to disagree with that?

A No.

Q And in 2009, would you agree that your corporation made around $425,000 for your efforts like this?

A I can’t argue it since I haven’t looked back, I have no idea.

Q Do you have any reason to disagree with that figure?

A No, but as I said, I just haven’t looked at it.

Q So in the last five years, including this year, your corporation has made approximately $2 million dollars for this type of work that you do, correct?

A That’s correct.

Q And you have made over a million dollars doing this type of work?

A Correct.

Q And when we talk about your corporation, your wife works as part of that corporation, is that correct?

A She does not.

Q She did at one point though? She acted as office manager?

A She has never been paid a cent by the company. She does help me, but she does help me.

Q Did you have one or more of your children work for that company before?

A I have.

Q Do you still have one or more children working for that company?

A They do.

Q Do they get paid from the money that goes to your corporation?

A They do.

Q And you’re a hundred percent shareholder in that corporation?

A I am.

Q Now, you had mentioned that Mr. Peake was asking you about in medical malpractice cases, the break down of your work and I just want to be clear here. Have you ever testified in a deposition anywhere in the country that a doctor deviated from the standard of care?

A No.

Q You have testified several times that doctors complied with the standard of care?

A I have.

Q Have you ever testified at trial that any doctor anywhere in the United States deviated from the standard of care?

A No, I have not.

Q You have testified at trial several times that doctors, like here today, did not do anything wrong, correct?

A That’s correct.

Q And one of the things we mentioned is that you reviewed a case three years ago for a lawyer and gave a favorable opinion, is that correct?

A Yes.

Q Now, that lawyer was a lawyer from Denver, Colorado, is that correct?

A That is correct.

Q And he is a personal friend of yours, correct?

A He is.

Q And then you mentioned that you reviewed a case for my partner, Trey Smith, isn’t it true that in that case you were actually the treating physician of that case. This wasn’t an expert witness role?

A That is correct.
