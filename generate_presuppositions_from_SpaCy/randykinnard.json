[{"question": "The doctor and I haven't met before, have we?"}, {"question": "I notice defense counsel referred to April 16th as Easter Sunday."}, {"question": "The doctor was born in 1962?"}, {"question": "When the doctor was six, I was in Vietnam. Okay?"}, {"question": "We had New Years Day, Easter, July 4th, Thanksgiving, Christmas Day. We were in the jungle fighting the enemy. Do you think we let our guard down on Easter?"}, {"question": "You\u2019re right. In the doctor's profession, not only in the doctor's profession, but there are a lot of professions where people have to work on holidays. True?"}, {"question": "Firemen, policemen, pilots, air traffic controllers, all kinds of people have to work on the holidays, don\u2019t they?"}, {"question": "And people who work on holidays still have to be careful and be safe. True?"}, {"question": "So, in the doctor's profession, the doctor has to be careful on a holiday just as any other day. Is that fair?"}, {"question": "So, the standard of care in this case on April 16 was the same as it would have been on Monday or Wednesday. Do you agree?"}, {"question": "Okay. I want to talk with the doctor about one thing really. And that\u2019s this April 16, Sunday, the time when Dr. White is called up to the ICU. This is what I really want to focus with the doctor on. Okay?"}, {"question": "You agree that caring for patients is a team effort, don\u2019t you?"}, {"question": "Looking after this patient on that Sunday, the doctor had Dr. Reimers there, the doctor had a nurse in the ICU, and the doctor had Dr. White who was part of the team. Correct?"}, {"question": "And I need to look just a second at some of the things that haven\u2019t been discussed at all yet in this record or that there has been very little discussion about it. This is at Page 111, Doctor. You ought to be able to see this okay. At 8:30 Bette Donathan gets a narcotic. Right? Up here."}, {"question": "All right. So, Bette Donathan is getting narcotics. And at 8:30 she\u2019s sleeping. See that?"}, {"question": "So, 9:30, Bette Donathan is sleeping, isn\u2019t she?"}, {"question": "I highlighted that in pink, I guess, there. Then at 10:00 Bette Donathan is up in the chair without difficulty. Right?"}, {"question": "Then at 10:30, Dr. White comes by, and there has been testimony that everything was looking good at that time. Are you with me?"}, {"question": "Okay. Then at 10:45 Bette Donathan has some pain in the right leg and they give her a narcotic again. Right?"}, {"question": "Excuse me. That\u2019s the anti-inflammatory?"}, {"question": "Okay. Excuse me. Now, at 11:00, Bette Donathan, obviously, is sitting up in order to have her hair washed. Right?"}, {"question": "And a nurse is taking Bette Donathan's head and washing her hair. Right?"}, {"question": "Of course. And we all know that the spinal cord runs from the base of the brain down, all of the way down as far as it goes in the back. Right?"}, {"question": "All right. And, now, Bette Donathan screams. Right?"}, {"question": "And you can imagine the shock on the nurse when this happens, the perfectly normal patient recovering nicely after surgery and, now, the nurse is washing her hair and she screams. Highly unusual, isn\u2019t it?"}, {"question": "And Bette Donathan complains of\u2014I\u2019ve taken a list. I have a list here, Doctor. Screaming in pain. Bette Donathan is talking about left hip and her back and leg cramps. She\u2019s letting the nurse know. The nurse is asking her, obviously, we\u2019ve recreated this. We\u2019ll try to recreate this. She screams in pain. The nurse had to ask her what\u2019s wrong. Bette said, my left hip and back is hurting, and I have leg cramps. And she tells the nurse I can\u2019t get any relief. She\u2019s put back in the bed. She\u2019s repositioned in the bed and she\u2019s turning and she can\u2019t get relief. She says more to the nurse, she have cramps in my legs and now it\u2019s in her upper back, and then this record shows she now has numbness in her legs. These are all things that the doctor told Mr. Geracioti are consistent with a spinal hematoma. Correct?"}, {"question": "Okay. Now, these are in the nurses\u2019 notes. And before Dr. White comes up, does the doctor remember from the facts that Dr. Reimers made a note. Does he remember that?"}, {"question": "Regardless of when Dr. White saw this note, Dr. Reimers makes these observations. And we see an entry here at 11:30. Do you see that, Doctor?"}, {"question": "Now, let\u2019s focus more on what this page has. Dr. Reimers obviously asked Bette Donathan, hey, how are you. Excruciating cramps in hips, left greater than right. Correct?"}, {"question": "We don\u2019t know what the problem is, but the patient is telling these people things that are serious. Right?"}, {"question": "The note does say moaning. This patient is moaning, crying and diaphoretic. It means she\u2019s sweating she\u2019s in so much pain. This is not good. Fair?"}, {"question": "This is another note by Dr. Reimers. The patient is now complaining of numbness in what, Doctor?"}, {"question": "The patient is unable to raise leg. Do you see that?"}, {"question": "Now, looking at Dr. Reimers\u2019s note, I think that the doctor will agree that what happened was that the patient was sitting up having her hair washed, she screamed out, and the record shows she\u2019s back repositioned in the bed and she\u2019s tossing in the bed. Dr. Reimers comes along. And Dr. Reimers talks to the patient, also. And she does an exam likely while the patient is lying flat on her back in the bed. Correct?"}, {"question": "Well, let\u2019s look at Dr. Reimer's note. You see that Dr. Reimers has got some notes there about testing pulses somewhere on there. There it is. Right there. See that?"}, {"question": "Now, that is totally possible and probable that the patient is now lying on her\u2014in fact, right now is the time I need to go over there, Your Honor, if I could. Now, she\u2019s probably on her back. And the doctor can feel the pulses in her ankles you know if you came in the room, I\u2019m flat on my back, you could feel my pulses in my ankles. Right?"}, {"question": "If the doctor is thinking maybe I\u2019ve got a vascular problem or something, the doctor could see how my pulses are doing. True?"}, {"question": "So, Dr. Reimers could stand here and feel my pulses and feel for spasm and not feel anything. True?"}, {"question": "Well, the point is, Doctor, Bette Donathan is on her back. Right?"}, {"question": "Well, I don\u2019t know either, Doctor, but I\u2019m just thinking of probabilities here. Okay. Now, we continue our list of Dr. Reimers\u2019s entry, moaning, crying, sweating. And Bette Donathan tells Dr. Reimers she has numbness in her left lower leg and she can\u2019t raise her left leg. If she\u2019s on her back and she can\u2019t raise her left leg, that could be due to pain. Correct?"}, {"question": "It could have hurt her so much. In fact, Dr. Reimers could have said, \"\"raise your left leg for me\"\". Bette Donathan said \"\"I can\u2019t, it\u2019s killing me\"\". That could have happened?"}, {"question": "All of this happened, as the doctor understands it, Bette Donathan told the nurse and Dr. Reimers that she has pain in her hips, back, and leg. Right?"}, {"question": "Before Dr. White gets to Bette Donathan's room. Right?"}, {"question": "Well, does the doctor think part of it was while Dr. White was there?"}, {"question": "As the jury well knows by now, I cannot draw, Doctor. But there is a Nurse Hazard in the intensive care unit. Right?"}, {"question": "We have Dr. Reimers at the bedside of the patient. True?"}, {"question": "And Dr. White comes up stat to the ICU. True?"}, {"question": "Dr. White has two people, Dr. Reimers and Nurse Hazard, that Bette Donathan has given a world of information to about the problems that have happened to her. Correct?"}, {"question": "Are you telling me, Doctor, that somehow these two team members, Dr. Reimers and Nurse Hazard, did not tell Dr. White any of the things that Bette Donathan had complained about? Are you telling us that?"}, {"question": "Well, how\u2014this team is supposed to be protecting this patient. Right?"}, {"question": "How could a team of three people, two with very important information, how could a team member not know all of this?"}, {"question": "Somebody should have gotten that information to Dr. White. Do you agree?"}, {"question": "Yes, Dr. Reimers had full ability to recognize and move on the information as well. We\u2019ll come back to that in a minute. I made a note, Doctor. Mr. Geracioti asked you about what did the standard of care require of Dr. White when she came up. And the standard of care required Dr. White to get a history, didn\u2019t it?"}, {"question": "Okay. Would you look up the word history for us, please?"}, {"question": "Would you read what Webster says history is?"}, {"question": "And that\u2019s what a history is that you doctors get. You want\u2014not only do you want how the patient is feeling, but what has led up to the patient's problems. Correct?"}, {"question": "And the standard of care is to ask not only how the patient is, but what has led up to the patient's problems. Correct?"}, {"question": "You\u2019d want to know as a careful surgeon what has happened to Bette Donathan since you were last with her. You\u2019d want to know that, wouldn\u2019t you?"}, {"question": "Well, what did Dr. White say she asked Bette Donathan?"}, {"question": "Did the doctor read Dr. White\u2019s deposition to form his opinions on this case?"}, {"question": "The doctor relied upon Dr. White's deposition to form his opinions on this case?"}, {"question": "Well, to refresh your memory, Page 56, Line 24. The question to Dr. White was \"\"and did you determine that Bette Donathan even complained of hip, back, and leg pain before you were trying to get an MRI done?\"\", and her answer was, \"\"I can\u2019t remember if Bette, if she had. I hadn\u2019t been told about it and she didn\u2019t tell me because when I sat down and I talked to her and I looked her in the eyes, and I said, describe your pain to me. Tell me exactly what you are feeling\"\". Do you see that, Doctor?"}, {"question": "I don\u2019t see anywhere in here that Dr. White said \"\"tell me everything that\u2019s happened to Bette Donathan since I was last here, what\u2019s been going on\"\". Do you see that there?"}, {"question": "Dr. White saying \"\"tell me everything that\u2019s happened to Bette Donathan since I was last here, what\u2019s been going on\"\" should have been written on the medical history, shouldn\u2019t it?"}, {"question": "Well, you know, before Dr. White came along, they gave Bette Donathan, not only had Bette Donathan been getting narcotics that morning, the hospital staff gave her morphine. Do you remember that?"}, {"question": "And Nurse Hazard has testified that this entry right here means that Bette Donathan stopped breathing. She passed out. And Nurse Hazard was so worried she called for the people that help patients with breathing problems, that department known as respiratory therapy. And they come running up there. And Nurse Hazard said she was out. She had stopped breathing. And then Nurse Hazard said \"\"I rubbed on her chest. I yelled at her to try to get her to come to\"\". And Nurse Hazard was very, very worried. Okay. Assume all of that is true. Now, Dr. White\u2014there is an entry at 11:52. And at 11:54, patient more alert. Do you see that?"}, {"question": "That means that Nurse Hazard was worried Bette Donathan, I could lose this patient, she\u2019s not breathing, she\u2019s passed out, and, now, thank God, she\u2019s more alert. Okay. Assume those facts are true. Who is a better historian about what\u2019s been going on, a woman who\u2019s coming out of this phase she\u2019s in and this state, having had narcotics, passed out, stopped breathing, Bette Donathan, or Dr. Reimers and Nurse Hazard?"}, {"question": "Bette Donathan had had some narcotics. Dr. Reimers got there. And the record will show when Dr. Reimers was there. And my last question to you, Doctor, is you gave a statement in this case that you signed about your opinions in this matter. Remember?"}, {"question": "Okay. And is it the doctor's opinion that an epidural catheter placed for post-op pain control should not have been used in Mrs. Donathan\u2019s case?"}, {"question": "That\u2019s all, Your Honor."}]
