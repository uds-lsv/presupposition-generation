 And you are no stranger to the legal process, are you, sir?
 Well, having given in excess of 400 depositions, you understand parts of the legal process, you understand why depositions are taken and so forth?
 Well, what I’m trying to get at is you said it was 50 two years ago, and we are now at two years later, and we know you’ve testified in court at least seven or eight times over the last two years, correct?
 Well, Doctor, can we agree that, in any event, that a substantial amount of your professional time is devoted to dealing with lawyers?
 Doctor, it is very misleading to tell this jury that your legal work is done at four in the morning and on weekends, isn’t it, sir? Isn’t that just a little misleading?
 Well, I’ve got — I don’t have all 400 of your depositions here, but I’ve got about 80, and I would be happy to go through them if the need arises. But I would represent to you, sir, that in all 80 of these depositions, not a single one was taken at 4:00 a.m. or on the weekends. Every single one was taken on a weekday between nine and five. Could you accept that possibility, sir, or should we walk through them?
 Doctor, I’m not arguing whether it’s done on your own time or not. I’m simply saying that it would be misleading to tell this jury that the legal work that you do is done at 4:00 a.m. and on weekends when we know that a good part of it is done Monday through Friday between nine and five.
 And, in fact, Doctor, the answer you just gave us, about you doing legal work at 4:00 a.m. and on the weekends, that’s an answer that you give quite frequently, isn’t it, sir?
 And when you were in Jacksonville last year –do you remember going to Jacksonville to testify?
 Do you remember who you testified for, sir?
 Yes, sir, and Mr. Dennis paid you, right?
 Yes, sir. Well, we’re going to talk a little bit more about your charges, sir. But that case over in Jacksonville — you told the jury the same thing. You get up at 4:00 a.m., you do the work on — at 4:00 a.m. and on the weekends. Do you recall that testimony?
 We’ll come back to that in just a moment, Doctor. Doctor, see if you remember this question. I’m trying to find out — look for the specific part of what I’m trying to find here. Ah, yes.
 And, in fact, Dr. Radetsky, that was not the first case in which you testified for Mr. Dennis’s firm or the George, Hartz, and Lundeen firm, is it?
 Yes, sir. What I was trying to get at was the magnitude. You didn’t tell us how many times you had been hired by Mr. Dennis’s firm or Ms. Santoro’s firm. That’s what I was trying to get at. And, in fact, sir, you’ve been hired, between those two law firms — not just her firm, probably 21, 22 times; is that fair?
 How many?
 Do you remember who you testified for, sir?
 Yes, sir, and Mr. Dennis paid you, right?
 But, in any event, can we agree, Doctor, that in the 450 cases in which you’ve testified, either by deposition or at trial, that in 95 percent of the cases you’ve testified for the defendants and against the patient?
 Yes, sir. You are brought there by and paid for by a defense lawyer to testify in a case against a baby or a baby’s parents. Isn’t that true, sir?
 Yes, sir. Well, how about you and I not quibble about words. In 95 percent of the cases you-are paid by the defense; can we agree to that?
 And in 95 percent of the cases you come in and you tell a jury that the defendant did nothing wrong or anything the defendant did didn’t cause an injury or death?
 Doctor, can we at least agree that in 95 percent of these cases in which a lawsuit is brought by a parent or by a child against a doctor or healthcare provider, your testimony is paid for by the defendant?
 In fact, Doctor, in all the 25 years that you’ve been doing this, you’ve only come in and testified for a patient or a patient’s family how many times at trial?
 Four times in 25 years?
 Doctor, would it be fair to say that with respect to the testimony you have given in the past in deposition that you have given wildly inconsistent testimony about the number of times that you’ve testified and who you’ve testified for and so forth? Can we at least agree to that?
 Well, let’s — well, Doctor, in the year – let’s go back to the 19 — no, we won’t go back that far, let’s start in 1999. Eight years ago. In 1999, sir, every time you testified in court or by deposition, it was for a defendant, wasn’t it?
 Well, that’s fair. I appreciate you telling me that. Do you recall your deposition being taken in the Palmer versus Keller case on April 27th, 2001, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Page 14. See if you remember being asked these questions and giving this answer. Line 16. In 1999, those 28 times you testified in medical malpractice cases, was every one of those testimonies for the defendant doctor or hospital? Answer, I believe so.
 Do you recall that question and that answer, sir?
 Do you recall, sir, that in the year 1998 every case you testified in was for a defendant, 100 percent of the cases?
 I appreciate you telling me. Same deposition, page 15, line four. Question: And in 1998 was 100 percent of your testimony for cases on behalf of the defendants? Answer, Yes.
 Do you recall that testimony, sir?
 Now, these days, Doctor, you’re giving – what would you say, 30, 40 depositions a year?
 Thirty would be a fair number, you think?
 You know, in the first two months of this year alone you had given at least five or six depositions; would that be fair, sir?
 What you did do at some point though, Doctor, was create a list of cases in which you testified. Do you recall doing that?
 Yes, sir. And you created that list on your computer, didn’t you?
 And since that time you’ve been asked for that list by many, many lawyers, haven’t you, sir?
 Yes, sir, you were, because you reviewed the deposition you gave in this case, right?
 And it turns out that with respect to that list — and you’ve been asked for it by lawyers other than just us, sir; isn’t that true?
 Doctor, were we the first lawyers to ask for that list?
 So the answer would be yes, other lawyers have asked you for the list?
 And what you’ve told those lawyers, sir, is that you can’t create a copy of a list. You haven’t kept a copy of it. Isn’t that correct?
 Now, after you compiled the list, what did you do with it?
 And you deleted it from your computer?
 Now, Doctor Radetsky, how much are you being paid in this case? I know what your hourly rate is. I want to know how much — by the time you get back to New Mexico — what the total bill for the defendants is going to be for your work in this case?
 No, sir. I’m sorry. I didn’t ask the question right. What I thought I asked — well, I’ll try to ask better — is what is your total bill going to be, what — for all of the work that you’ve done in this case?
 Well, I understand you may not know it to the nickel, but give our jury the best estimate as to what your charges are going to be.
 Well, I understand that you don’t, you don’t have all the invoices. I’m just asking for an approximation. Give us your best approximation as to what your total charges are going to be.
 So could it be 30, 40, $50,000?
 Could it be as high as 30 or $40,000?
 Doctor, let me rephrase the question. Can you give our jury your best estimate – I’m not asking you to the penny, but say within $5,000, give the jury your best estimate as to what your total charges are going to be for your work in this case.
 Well, let’s move on.
 Let’s visit, if we could, a little bit about Levi Slayton. And I listened carefully to your testimony. And I wrote down some notes. And correct me if I’m wrong, but your testimony is based upon the assumption that Levi Slayton was not sick before the illness occurred, and the illness being the time that he stopped breathing; is that correct?
 That’s an assumption of yours in this case?
 It’s based upon your belief that that represents the true state of facts; can we at least agree to that?
 In any event, your understanding is Levi had no illnesses prior to his instantaneous death, correct?
 Is that a yes?
 As far as you know, he had no illnesses prior to the time he stopped breathing; is that fair or not?
 Well, Doctor, using your definition of illness, can we at least agree that you believe that Levi had no illnesses until he stopped breathing?
 You’ve read the deposition of Julie Slayton?
 You don’t question her truthfulness or her memory, do you?
 Let me ask you this. You — you understood why we went out, or why we took your deposition that was taken in Albuquerque?
 And from the 400 plus depositions you’ve given, you understand that the reason we do that is so we can find out what opinions you have and what thoughts you have and so we can prepare ourselves for a trial like this. You understand that’s the purpose of the deposition.
 Yes. Because folks like us, we’re lawyers, we’re not doctors, so we want to try to be thorough and get out all your opinions at the time of the deposition. And you understand that’s the process?
 But you knew it long before that, didn’t you?
 Yes, sir. And you probably know that from law school, right? You went to law school, didn’t you?
 And did you learn about depositions at law school?
 In any event, Doctor, while you and I may disagree about some things about Levi Slayton, one of the things we can agree on is that, for at least a day or so leading up to the time that Levi Slayton stopped breathing, for at least a day or so, maybe more, Levi Slayton had pneumonia?
 Do you have your deposition there, Doctor?
 Page 60?
 Six-oh, yes, sir.
 See if you remember this question being asked and you giving this answer. So now, if I understand correctly, Doctor, you don’t believe Levi had any illness up until the time that he stopped breathing?
 Do you remember giving that answer to that question?
 No, sir, you didn’t. Now, if in fact, as you testified under oath, Levi had pneumonia at least a day or so before he stopped breathing, Levi would have had pneumonia at the
 All right, but essentially — and we’ll get into the facts and figures later — but the majority of your professional life is spent working for lawyers or insurance companies, is that fair to say?
 All right, and what that means is when you’re in a forensic context, you’re not treating anyone, is that right?
 But at this point in time your forensic work does not involve helping people to get better in any way?
 All right, and it’s the forensic psychiatrist’s responsibility to highlight and emphasize facts favorable to the side that hired them and to de-emphasize or ignore facts that don’t help the side that hired them, is that fair to say?
 Isn’t that what most forensic psychiatrists believe?
 Yes, yes.
 You filed an affidavit for the judge in this case, do you recall that, actually, a declaration?
 All right, and a declaration is a statement under oath upon which a party offers and asks the Court to rely upon, is that right?
 Yes, and you’re very familiar with declarations and how the court systems work, aren’t you?
 All right, and in your declaration you cited to Judge Mahan a book called Principles and Practices — Principles and Practice of Forensic Psychiatry, Second Edition, are you familiar with that book?
 If you’d turn to page five, lines seven and eight.
 Did you cite that text to the judge?
 And you cited it to the judge because you considered it a reliable resource regarding forensic psychiatry, is that right?
 Well, you wouldn’t be citing the Court to an unreliable source in forensic psychiatry, would you?
 So you’re kind of picking and choosing amongst the portions of the book that will support your case and the portions that don’t?
 I wasn’t asking you to admit it was authoritative, but you thought the book was a reliable resource, didn’t you, that’s why you own it, that’s why you cited it to the judge?
 All right. Well, let me ask you about a section in your book –
 This is from page 11 in the book, Dr. Rosenberg, and it reads, both attorneys and forensic psychiatrists —
 Most attorneys and forensic psychiatrists consider it the responsibility of the forensic psychiatrist to put a spin on the data and highlight and emphasize facts favorable to their side and de-emphasize or even ignore data that are not. Do you agree with that statement?
 Well, that’s what you did in this case, isn’t it, Dr. Rosenberg, you highlighted the facts that support your malingering theory and deemphasized or ignored the facts that don’t support that theory?
 Tell us the facts that appear in your report that support the theory that Mr. Mead is genuinely disabled.
 That’s it? Those are the only facts you came up with in your entire evaluation that support Mr. Mead’s claim of disability, is that right?
 One of the things that forensic psychiatrists do is evaluate the credibility of sources, is that right, sources of information?
 All right, and you found Gena Mead to be a relative [relevant] source of information, is that right?
 So did you consider that her reports about Mr. Mead and his disabilities were credible?
 Well, is it a subjective statement if she reports what she observed from living with him for twenty-eight years? Is that — do you consider that subjective?
 And both of those things are true of you, aren’t they, Doctor? What you’ve given us is your personal interpretation of the facts, just like Gena Mead did, and you yourself have an economic motive, don’t you?
 Aren’t you supposed to weigh the evidence in favor of your hypothesis as well as the evidence against your hypothesis?
 All right, and where on your report did you weigh the evidence of Gena Mead’s reports of Cliff Mead’s physical degeneration over a period of years?
 But not the facts that would be relevant in support of the theory that Mr. Mead is disabled, is that right?
 What you’re doing is you’re picking and choosing from Ms. Mead’s deposition taking the portions that support your theory and ignoring or de-emphasizing the rest, isn’t that right?
 Did you just say that you started out with the opinion he was malingering, and then you were supplied with reasons to support it?
 I’m sorry, is that what you psychiatrists call a Freudian slip?
 Did I understand from your testimony that you wrote a chapter or article in a book called Comprehensive Textbook on Psychiatry, a chapter on ethics?
 Would you show me where in the book that chapter is?
 Oh, so you don’t have a current edition of this book with your article in it?
 You weren’t trying to mislead anybody by implying — well, you weren’t trying to mislead anybody by saying that you had a chapter on ethics in the Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, were you?
 So as I understand it, you spend one day a week with patients?
 How many minutes is that per patient?
 Fifteen to thirty minutes times thirty patients, and what do you do for patients in fifteen to thirty minutes?
 Out of these thirty patients you see a day, approximately how many are you prescribing medications for?
 So basically they come in to you to get their medications, and you make sure it’s appropriate to keep giving them their medications, is that fair to say?
 Ninety percent of your income comes from forensic work?
 You’ve spoken to insurance company trade groups on occasion?
 And in that talk you addressed the subject of objectifying subjective complaints?
 Do you recall testifying in a case called Abner versus Paul Revere Insurance Company?
 Let me just show you page 93 from your deposition in that case. [Pause for sidebar conference.] All I wanted to ask, Doctor, is whether this refreshes your recollection about talking about teaching the insurance people about objectifying subjective complaints?
 Now, as I understand it, you do — well, I should just ask you — I think you told us you’ve done thirty to thirty-five IME’s for Unum Provident?
 All right, that includes Paul Revere, and Provident, and Unum?
 All right, and when they hired — let’s make a distinction between cases in litigation and cases that are not in litigation. That thirty to thirty-five for Unum Provident related companies is for cases not in litigation, is that correct?
 All right, and when they hire you to do these IME’s, you give them a reduced rate, don’t you?
 In fact, didn’t you testify in the Abner trial that you put a cap on your evaluation charges to them which effectively gives them a reduced rate?
 I am going to show you page 14 of the transcript of the trial . I think it’s of your transcript in the trial. You were asked by Mr. Quigley (phonetic), I believe, well, you’ve got a reduced rate with the insurance companies for doing evaluations and writing reports, so even if you spend a lot of hours over that $4,000.00, you don’t charge them for that, right? And you answered, that’s correct. Does that sound about right?
 How many of these evaluations do you do each month?
 I’m asking how many forensic evaluations do you do a month?
 Does three to eight sound a little more accurate?
 You’ve also been hired by Barger and Wolen which is Mr. McKennon and Mr. Hess’s firm on occasion, haven’t you?
 Approximately how many times?
 Do you recall testifying in Abner that Barger and Wolen had hired you between five and ten times to work on Unum Provident cases?
 In fact, at page 16 Mr. Quigley asked you, is it true that there have been five cases that you’ve been asked to be an expert on in litigation for Paul Revere or Provident that you have been retained by the Barger and Wolen firm? And you answered, actually, I think in my deposition I had said over a period of years, it has been more like five to ten. Does that sound about right?
 And that’s just talking about the time Barger and Wolen hired you for Unum Provident cases, is that right?
 And in those cases there’s no cap like there is in the prelitigation cases, correct?
 And you told us you’ve spent — or you’ve charged $20,000.00 in this case up until recently when you began to prepare for it again. Roughly how much time do you have in it since you completed your report?
 At $300.00 an hour?
 So another $9,000.00.
 All right. Now, at the time you testified in Abner, in every case you could remember being hired by Barger and Wolen to defend Unum Provident, you had concluded that the plaintiff was a malingerer, is that right?
 By the way, these inconsistencies in your testimony today versus your testimony before, does that raise in your mind a credibility issue similar to what you’ve told us about Mr. Mead?
 In each of the cases in which you were hired by Barger and Wolen, you disagreed with the treating doctors, isn’t that right?
 How many people have had their claims denied because of your reports or testimony?
 How many times have you given reports — well, let me ask it this way. Of the times you’ve expressed the opinion that in a forensic setting — you say you’ve done roughly a thousand?
 All right, let me start over. So out of the roughly a thousand times you’ve expressed an opinion in a forensic setting, how many times were you right and how many times were you wrong?
 Well, let me ask a more pointed question. There is no way to quantify your error rate, is there?
 Is there any way to tell scientifically?
 And the methods that you use are the methods of forensic psychiatry, is that right?
 Now, I think you told us earlier that the job of a forensic psychiatrist is to evaluate the credibility of information — not the only job but one of the jobs — is to evaluate the credibility of information sources?
 And one of the relevant information sources you’ve talked about today is Dr. Lees-Haley, is that correct?
 And you’ve described him as a world authority?
 Is it your view that Dr. Haley is an unbiased information source?
 If he were a biased information source, would that alter the way he influences your opinions?
 Well, you’re dependent upon him, for example, let’s take this report, if he said Mr. Mead was fatigued, or Mr. Mead was energized, you have no way of knowing either way, right, in terms of what he observed in the session?
 So, you’re dependent upon his credibility to the extent you’re relying upon his use of that information, is that fair to say?
 All right. Now, were you given Dr. Lees-Haley’s deposition in this case?
 And are you aware of Dr. Lees-Haley’s efforts to market himself to the insurance industry?
 Were you given his deposition in the Northwestern case?
 Okay, and in that deposition , or we’ve got the report, he did one examination of Mr. Mead, is that correct?
 For this case and the Northwestern case, is that correct?
 All right, and if you were to become aware that Dr. Lees-Haley had addressed insurance agents and adjusters and told them not to bother calling — I’m sorry — not to call him until they’re ready to deny the claim, and basically told them he was on their side and was there to help them deny the claim, would that influence your view of his credibility?
 All right. We’ll get to evidence of distortion later. For now, have you ever met Dr. Lees-Haley?
 Is it the proper role of a medical person or a scientist to become an advocate in order to help insurance companies deny claims?
 Are you aware that Dr. Lees-Haley was a contributing editor to Claims Magazine for a number of years?
 What percentage of the time is Dr. Haley — or Lees-Haley retained by insurance companies or the defense?
 I am going to hand you the deposition of Dr. Haley. Page 42, line 16, do you see where Dr. Lees-Haley is testifying that for the last several years between ninety-five and ninety-nine percent of the cases for which he’s been retained as a forensic expert has been for defense cases?
 Does that suggest to you any kind of bias?
 Distorting facts would be highly inappropriate for a forensic expert, wouldn’t it?
 All right, and just if you’d take a look at page 47, do you see that Mr. Lees — Dr. Lees-Haley’s work basically over ninety-five percent of his income comes from forensic work?
 And on page 39 that he co-edited a handbook on psychological claims for insurance companies?
 Coauthored another book that a surveillance expert markets to insurance companies? Page 40.
 Does any of that suggest any issues with regard to Dr. Haley’s credibility or lack of bias?
 Now, when you write a report calling somebody a malingerer, basically you’re calling them a liar and a fraud, is that right?
 And so before you do something like that, you want to be really sure you’ve got it right, isn’t that correct?
 You know that if you — well, it would be a horrible thing, wouldn’t it, if you accused somebody of being a liar and a fraud and they lost their disability benefits and you were wrong?
 And you want to make sure you look at all of the available evidence before you form an opinion like that, don’t you?
 Well, how do you decide what’s sufficient?
 You wouldn’t base an opinion of malingering on speculation, would you?
 And if you discovered that there was important evidence, you had not been given, you wouldn’t be reluctant to change your mind, would you?
 Do you think it’s relevant and significant that Gena Mead thinks and observed Cliff Mead’s health deteriorating over a period of years, is that significant in your mind?
 So you rely upon some of the things she says but not others, is that right?
 Is there something that shows she’s lying when she describes his deterioration over a period of years?
 All right, and that financial interest — well, let me ask you this, how did you weigh in the fact that Mr. Mead and Gena Mead had a divorce case going at the time she testified about the affair?
 So is Gena Mead lying when she tells us about what she observed with regard to Cliff Mead’s health over the years?
 All right, so you’re basically saying, yes, you believe that information is not worth weighing in the balance as you decide — as you try to decide whether Mr. Mead’s telling the truth or not.
 You weighed it and then threw it out?
 Who else can you tell us is lying, Dr. Rosenberg?
 And Mrs. Mead, Gena Mead, who else?
 You don’t believe her, do you?
 A good lawyer or forensic psychiatrist could come up with reasons to disbelieve just about anyone, couldn’t they?
 What reasons are there to disbelieve Mr. Mead’s partners when they testify?
 I think you misunderstood my question. I’m talking about his business partners, what reasons are there to be skeptical of their testimony? This is an easy one.
 This skepticism you’re describing, did you feel skeptical about what the partners were saying?
 Were you aware that the partners and Mr. Mead had a lawsuit against each other?
 That would be a reason to be skeptical, wouldn’t it?
 Dr. Rosenberg, I want to make sure that my notes are correct. Did you testify that one of the more significant pieces of evidence was how Mr. Mead had rated his levels of distress with Dr. Lees-Haley?
 So the fact that he put CFS as a more severe distress than, say, the death of his son, to you means he’s malingering and trying to push his CFS claim inappropriately?
 What would be a reasonable characterization?
 Didn’t Mr. Mead say to Dr. Lees-Haley that the most emotionally distressing experience of his entire life was the death of his son in 1996?
 Do you have a copy of Dr. Lees-Haley’s report with you?
 Would you turn to page 5, please. Do you have it on your computer?
 What Mr. Mead told Dr. Lees-Haley was that the most emotionally distressing experience of his entire life was the death of his son in 1996, wasn’t it?
 He said the second most emotionally distressing experience was the death of his mother in December of 2000 from breast cancer, and the death of his younger brother by heart attack in March of 2001, isn’t that right?
 You weren’t trying to leave the jury with the impression that Mr. Mead had said that having CFS was more emotionally distressing than the death of people in his family, were you, Dr. Rosenberg?
 All right, and what he was asked about was several dozen psychosocial stressors and asked to talk about them with regard to the past twelve months, is that right?
 And at this point it’s what? Five years after his son has died?
 It’s kind of hard to see here, Dr. Rosenberg, but can you tell us what the trails making Test is?
 And basically the trails making test, test A tests visual scanning and attention, is that right, visual scanning and attention?
 Yes. What the trails making A is concerned with is visual scanning and attention, is that correct?
 All right, and on this test administered by Dr. Lees-Haley, Mr. Mead did worse than 99 percent of the population, is that right?
 Am I pronouncing it right, Stroup (phonetic) Color Word Test, is that the way to pronounce it?
 All right, that deals with problems with attention and how vulnerable someone is to distraction, is that right?
 And there again he does worse than ninety-nine percent of the population?
 And on the second Stroup test, the interference test, that also tests how distractible he is?
 And on this frontal lobe measure, again he does worse than ninety-nine percent of the population?
 And according to Dr. Lees-Haley, the scores indicate that Mr. Mead’s overall ability to pay attention and concentrate is seemingly quite variable, is that right? I know there’s more to it, but that’s the first sentence, is that right?
 All right, and that’s actually consistent with what Mr. Mead had been reporting to his doctors for years, isn’t it, that sometimes he was able to concentrate and other times he had real troubles?
 What’s your understanding as to the exercise — you’ve read his deposition, what exercise does Mr. Mead do at present or at the time of his deposition?
 Well, hasn’t he testified that he also uses light weights occasionally and does stretching exercises as well?
 All right, and what’s your understanding of what his doctors have recommended to him?
 Well, right, let me just ask some leading questions to move us through this. You understand that Dr. Cheney was not only diagnosing Mr. Mead but also treating him, right?
 And you’ve had Dr. Cheney’s deposition, haven’t you?
 And do you agree that Dr. Cheney testified that he put Mr. Mead on an exercise regime that involved mild weight lifting, stretching, isometrics?
 Let me hand you page 491.
 That’s what Dr. Cheney said for him to do, isn’t it?
 So Mr. Mead is doing exactly what Dr. Cheney told him to do, isn’t he?
 But you’ve told us what your understanding is of what he’s doing, weight lifting, the stretching, so on, and that’s exactly what’s on the deposition, isn’t it?
 And what Dr. Cheney said is that they, meaning chronic fatigue syndrome patients, should play to their strength which is anaerobic — is their anaerobic system so mild weight lifting, stretching, isometrics, is generally well tolerated as they give ten seconds — excuse me, sixty seconds between reps. So he’s recommending anaerobic exercise of the sort we just described, isn’t that right?
 So we know that one basis for your opinion that Mr. Mead is not following the directions of his doctors isn’t true, do you agree with that?
 I didn’t think so. Would you agree that Mr. Mead had a good work ethic in college?
 Wouldn’t that be something worth knowing if you are going to evaluate whether he’s malingering or not?
 All right. Well, I guess what I’m asking you is — well, why don’t I just ask it this way. When did the malingering start?
 And what is his motive for malingering?
 So he’s a winner and a competitor in 1989, would you agree?
 1990?
 When did he decide to be a health ridden malingerer as opposed to a winner?
 So when he’s talking to his doctors and reporting symptoms in 1990, ‘ 91, ’92, is he malingering?
 All right. I’m just asking you, when he went to his doctors, and he said, I have these symptoms, was he malingering?
 Well, you’ve done that, haven’t you, you’ve looked at all of those medical records?
 Well, for example, when he goes to Dr. Epstein in ’92 and ’93, and he says he’s feeling depressed and fatigued, is he making that up? Is he lying?
 What’s his easily understood motive in 1992 for going into Dr. Epstein and talking of depression and fatigue, what’s his easily understood motive?
 Just to be clear, are you speculating about motives at this time, or do you have a scientific basis for telling us what his motive is in 1992?
 Let’s go back then to ’91 before his partners ever say a word to him about any kind of trouble, and you’re aware that his partners told him they wanted him to leave in August of ’96 — or I’m sorry, August of — I better look that up — the middle of ’92, is that right?
 And, in fact, Mr. Kitchen testified, didn’t he, that the first time they raised concerns with Mr. Mead about his performance was late 1991 or early ’92, correct?
 Late ’91?
 So why is he going to doctors starting in late ’90 all the way through ’91 complaining of fatigue, congestion, pain in the muscles, why is he doing all of that in ’90 and ’91?
 All right. Well, let me ask the question this way then because we don’t have much time as you know. What is the easily understood motive that Mr. Mead would have for lying to his doctors in 1990 and 1991?
 All right. Well, you read Mr. Kitchen’s deposition, didn’t you?
 And you would accept his description of the timing of when they told Mr. Mead certain things, wouldn’t you?
 You talked about the stressors that he had, which stressors did he have in ’91? We talked about the death of his son, the death of his mother, none of those stressors existed in ’91, did they?
 All right, and so you’re back to the business stressors, is that right?
 And he’d always had high pressure stressful jobs, hadn’t he?
 In your malingering analysis, you have to evaluate what somebody has to gain by their behavior against what they have to lose, correct?
 All right, and what he had to gain, if I understand what you’re telling us, is the money from the policy approximately — the two policies, Northwestern and Paul Revere — of about $180,000.00 a year, is that right?
 And lots of free time, is that right?
 What else did he have to gain?
 You said he wanted to pursue nonwork interests, what were those?
 What did he lose when he stopped working?
 Yeah, he lost his career, correct?
 What was his earning capacity in that career, do you know?
 How much — let’s talk first about how hard would it have been for him to get another job in the corporate world?
 And how much would that job that it would be easy for him to get pay?
 Maybe even more?
 All right. Now, by losing his job, he also lost his house, is that right?
 I don’t mean losing as in foreclosed on, but he couldn’t support a $2.5 million house on $180,000.00 a year, could he?
 And you don’t know the particulars of that, do you?
 You didn’t ask about the particulars of that, did you?
 But if you’re doing this evaluation of gain versus loss, that’s an important thing to know, isn’t it?
 Gena Mead testified that as a result of their reduction in income, they lost their house, their children were taken out of private schools, they lost their ski house, he lost his business friends and associates, and he lost his social standing, do you have any reason to disagree with any of that?
 You don’t have that information, do you?
 All right. Mr. Cummings and Mr. Kitchen each testified that Mr. Mead tried hard to stay in the partnership to keep his job, is that right?
 Is that what malingerers do, they try hard to keep their job?
 So the malingering began after he was pushed out of his job, is that what you are telling us?
 One of the reasons supporting your position is that his partners saw no evidence of sickness or illness, is that correct?
 And do you recall reading Mr. Kitchen’s deposition in which he said that after 1991, Mr. Mead appeared withdrawn, when a person is defeated, your posture is not quite the same, he was a little beaten, do you remember that?
 It was described as his change in personality after 1991, wasn’t it?
 Do you remember Mr. Kitchen saying that there was a possible change in his personality, Mr. Kitchen wasn’t sure, it might have always been there, but he started to notice that there was not a good two-way communication, it was difficult to communicate with Mr. Mead, do you recall that?
 And do you recall Mr. Kitchen saying that he appeared depressed?
 Do you remember the partners and employees all saying that they would not be surprised if Mr. Mead had health problems and didn’t show or tell them about them?
 Do you remember them saying he was a private person and that in this type of industry this is not the first thing you’d necessarily want out?
 Were you given Nancy McGinty’s deposition?
 So you haven’t heard that she knew him for ten years and always knew him to be a person of integrity, credibility, and honesty, is that right?
 That wasn’t my question. My question is, were you aware that she had testified that she knew him for ten years and always knew him to be a person of integrity, credibility, and honesty?
 You’re dependent on all the information, and the only information you get is what the defense attorneys give you, is that right?
 In terms of information beyond your examination of Mr. Mead, you’re dependent upon the defense lawyers, aren’t you?
 Did you insist on getting the depositions of the other employees who worked with Mr. Mead?
 Okay, and in your opinion knowing that the jury has heard that she knew him for ten years and always knew him to be a person of integrity, credibility, and honesty, do you think that Nancy McGinty is lying about that?
 Do you think knowing him for ten years, she might know more about him than you do?
 Is this information that would be important to you —
 — what Nancy McGinty testified to?
 Nancy Buckley, were you given her deposition?
 I’m sorry, Susan Buckley. And if she testified that in all of the years she’d known Mr. Mead from working with him at the partnership and knew him to be a person of integrity and an honest person, would that be important information?
 You weren’t given that either, were you?
 In fact, Mr. Kitchen testified that he thought the mistakes that — or the misjudgments — that Mr. Mead was making were honestly made and were not intentionally misleading, isn’t that right?
 You’ve — by the way, you formed your opinion and wrote your report without ever having seen the deposition of Gena Mead, isn’t that right?
 That’s not something you insisted on seeing before deciding that Mr. Mead was a liar and a malingerer?
 What did Mrs. Mead say about his health and activities? Oh, have you been provided her deposition?
 So you don’t know what she has to say about that?
 From the defense lawyers?
 From the defense lawyers?
 All right. Do you consider that an unbiased source of information?
 If Mrs. Mead testified to a deteriorating and difficult health condition, is she lying?
 Did they show you the claim file?
 You have the records where Mr. Mead is saying to Paul Revere tell me what test to take and I’ll go take it?
 Is that the sort of position you would expect a malingerer to take?
 By the way, since we’re on the subject of research, did you read his letters regarding Dr. Etcoff’s report?
 Do you agree with his analysis?
 He got it wrong, didn’t he?
 So Mr. Mead as he did this detailed sophisticated analysis that you were so impressed with actually was wrong, the analysis was flawed, wasn’t it?
 Dr. Lees-Haley says that the MMPI testing is the gold standard for malingering, would you agree with that?
 Well, I guess we’ve covered — you weren’t given Dr. Lees-Haley’s deposition, were you?
 In fact, Dr. Lees-Haley testified that Mr. Mead’s MMPI results showed the opposite of malingering, didn’t he?
 What did Dr. Lees-Haley say? Turn to page 184 of his deposition, please. Didn’t he say at page — beginning of page 183 that the MMPI results of Mr. Mead were the opposite of malingering? .
 Page 184, line 15, there’s nothing in your report of February 26, 2002, that states based on the MMPI-2 that I administered to Mr. Mead, I do not find that he was a malingerer, there is nothing here that states that, is there? Answer, yes, there is. I said he did just the opposite of that. He under reported. I just didn’t use the words you’re using. I made a very clear statement that he was doing just the opposite. Do you agree with that?
 And the MMPI is the most validated test, psychometric test, for the detection of malingering, isn’t it?
 In fact, Dr. Reznick, the person you said is probably the foremost expert in psychiatric assessment specifically says that the MMPI-2 is the most validated psychometric test for evaluating suspected malingering, doesn’t he?
 All right, so the most validated psychometric test says not only is he not malingering, he’s doing the opposite of it, isn’t that right?
 One of the reasons you give for believing that Mr. Mead is a malingerer is that he refused to let you tape, isn’t that right?
 And you wrote that in your report?
 And you gave it to the defense lawyers?
 And you told them you thought this was powerful evidence that he was malingering?
 Didn’t you tell us today that it was powerful evidence in support of your opinion that he is malingering?
 Did the defense lawyers then after receiving your report and hearing your opinions tell you that they were the ones who says there was not to be recordings of this session?
 All right. Did they ever tell you that when these appointments were scheduled, Mr. Mead wanted to bring a witness because he was afraid of attending an IME, and he was told he could not bring a witness?
 Did they ever tell you that when they told him he couldn’t bring a witness, they also told him he couldn’t videotape the session?
 Would that be important in interpreting his attitude when he shows up at his office having been told he can’t have a witness to see what you’re doing and he can’t record what you’re doing?
 Let me hand you what’s been marked as Exhibit 222. They never showed you this letter they wrote to Mr. Mead’s attorneys in which they said, finally it is our understanding that Mr. Mead does not intend to and will not videotape either evaluation and will not attempt to bring any witnesses to observe either evaluation. Is that right?
 All right. Would you have allowed him to videotape the deposition?
 Do you know why they didn’t want anybody to see what you were going to do in that evaluation?
 And you’re not privy to the conversations that took place between the lawyers what Mr. Mead’s lawyer may have instructed him after receiving this letter, are you?
 Actually, Dr. Rosenberg, didn’t he tell you that he had been told he couldn’t tape and, therefore, he didn’t want you to be taping, isn’t that what he told you?
 Well, Mr. McKennon or the defense lawyers gave you Dr. Cusher’s deposition, correct? Here’s what I’d like to do, if we can, because we’re running out of time. I would like to go through quickly what you were given and what you weren’t given, all right?
 You have your report there, so you have a list of what you were given?
 You were given Dr. Cusher’s deposition, correct, he is the in-house doctor for Paul Revere?
 You were given Dr. Anderson’s deposition, is that correct?
 Were you given the Connecticut Licensing Board’s sanction of Dr. Anderson for writing himself narcotic prescriptions?
 Did they give you Dr. Goldstein’s, he’s the in-house doctor, a review of Dr. Donaldson?
 Did they give you Dr. Rapoport’s deposition?
 Dr. Silber’s deposition?
 Any of the Mayo Clinic depositions?
 Your opinion is only as good as the information you’re given, isn’t that right?
 Exactly. Did they give you Dr. Epstein’s deposition?
 Dr. Epstein — I’m sorry, Dr. Iznik’s deposition?
 Dr. Squires deposition?
 Dr. Sandman’s deposition?
 We already discussed Mrs. Mead’s deposition, they didn’t give you that, they didn’t give you the two employees’ depositions, is that right?
 Did they give you Dr. Seggev’s records at all?
 Seggev.
 Did they give you Dr. Conley’s records?
 Yes.
 All right. That’s what is called cherry picking, isn’t it, when you take some things out of the records, but don’t give the rest, you’ve heard that term before?
 Do malingers ordinarily hide the problems they’re trying to malinger from the people around them?
 I’m talking about health problems, malingering health problems, do people who are trying to malinger health problems normally try to keep those secret from the people around them?
 Yes, there would. Do people who are malingering health problems ordinarily put forth great effort and do well on physical testing?
 Well, you know what we’re talking about, don’t you? You know that the medical records show that every time he was given a physical test, he worked hard and did well on it, you know that, don’t you?
 All right, and is that what you’d expect to see with a malingerer who is trying to malinger fatigue, muscle soreness?
 And so he’s claiming fatigue and muscle soreness and he’s doing well on physical tests, couldn’t that suggest to you, Dr. Rosenberg, that he’s a sick man who is also very proud and competitive, and he is working hard on these physical tests?
 I think you testified, or maybe it’s in your report, that he showed remarkable stamina in his meetings with you and Dr. Lees-Haley, is that right?
 And is that what somebody does when they’re malingering?
 So he’s smart enough to study up on these tests, he’s smart enough to write sophisticated letters, but he’s not smart enough to know that when he goes to an IME exam that he should try to look tired?
 In fact, didn’t Dr. Lees-Haley find — didn’t Dr. Lees-Haley find that he was fatigued during his meeting, or didn’t Dr. Lees-Haley say he appeared fatigued during his meeting with Dr. Lees-Haley?
 So why did you tell us this morning that he attended both yours and Dr. Lees-Haley’s sessions and showed no sign of fatigue?
 Well, Dr. Lees-Haley specifically said that he appeared — Mr. Mead appeared fatigued, do you recall — well, you’ve already said you recall that. Let me move on. Do you recall that Dr. Gardner testified that he did not doubt Mr. Mead’s credibility with regard to his symptoms?
 Let me just show you this on the screen. It’s from page 87 of Dr. Gardner’s deposition. He’s asked, did your impression that he didn’t open up, did that cause you to question his credibility regarding his objective complaints at all? No. Question, do you have any reason to question his credibility with regard to his subjective complaints? No. Is that what Dr. Gardner testified to?
 Is there anything, Dr. Rosenberg, that anybody could say that would cause you to change your opinion that Mr. Mead is a liar and a fraud?
 It’s not unusual for patients to read up on whatever condition they have, is it?
 And there’s nothing sinister about that, is there?
 Dr. Rosenberg, just to be clear, your opinion is that all the treating doctors got it wrong, is that correct?
 He fooled them all?
 Your focus is safety 100 percent?
 And because safety is very important of the vessel; is that right?
 It can be very dangerous working offshore, true?
 And because of that there’s all sorts of safety rules that Cal Dive has that are important; is that right?
 And Cal Dive has a pretty lengthy safety rule book; is that right?
 And the reason is — if you go to page 286 — Cal Dive has a vision of people going home safely. And I think you and I can agree not only people going home safely but people going home healthy, fair?
 (MR. ITKIN) And there is a section on conducting the formal investigation. And it says kind of in the middle of that first paragraph: A formal investigation shall be thorough and conscientious. Do you see that?
 And you agree — I mean, put aside you are not a paperwork guy. Even though you are in court with your suit on and everything, I hear you. You agree with that just in general principle?
 Do it thorough as you can?
 Be as accurate as you can?
 Is that right?
 One of the things that Cal Dive wants you to do as part of your job is to interview the people involved, right?
 And what they want you to do is take complete notes of what each person says. Do you agree, right?
 Okay. That’s what it says right there in Part B. I am not making this up.
 So, where it says here take complete notes of what each person says you didn’t do that?
 Okay. I mean, because if we go to the next page, it says: After the interview of each witness, write the interview summary of each person interviewed. Report what the person said in the interview using as many of the interviewed person’s words as possible. Do you see that?
 Didn’t do that because you didn’t take notes to go put the summary together, fair?
 Okay. I want to make a little timeline.
 I think it is pretty much undisputed — you can tell me if I am wrong — but 8:15 in the morning is when the fall happens, right?
 It could have been 8:45 that you interviewed him. It could have been sometime after 11:00, right?
 You don’t remember when?
 Sir, is it your testimony — can you tell us for a fact —
 — can you tell us for a fact under oath here today in court that after Nigel’s fall nobody came to use that hose and that power washer to clean that area?
 Uh-huh.
 You can?
 Even though the fall happened at 8:15?
 He saw the medic from 8:20 to 8:40?
 You didn’t interview him for almost three hours later?
 And you can tell us one 100 percent for a fact that nobody used that power washer?
 There is slick spot of oil there —
 — and someone saw it, they should clean it up, right?
 Okay. Right?
 One of the things you can use to clean a deck with is a hose, true?
 Power washer, true?
 Okay. Did you interview anyone as part of your formal investigation report to see if the water that you found on — the clean water that you found on that deck came from a power washer?
 Okay. Did you ask [the plaintiff] where he thought the oil came from?
 Did you ask him if anyone else had reported the oil?
 Did you ask him if anyone else had complained about the oil?
 Did you ask him if there were any other witnesses?
 Did you interview anybody else?
 Did you talk to anybody else about it?
 How many incident reports have you filled out in the course of your career?
 Okay. And when you do it, do you also do them with the same thoroughness that you did Mr. Bryant’s injury report?
 Hold on a second. Did you go ask anyone if they used the power washer?
 Do you have any logbook that says when people use the power washer?
 Okay. Are there certain people that use the power washer as part of their job?
 ABs?
 How many ABs did you have on duty between 8:15 a.m. and 11:02?
 Okay. Did you talk to any of those four about the power washer?
 Okay. Have you talked to any of those four at any time?
 Yes.
 Okay. Did you talk to Nigel’s supervisor?
 Did you talk to Nigel’s co-workers?
 Did you talk to anyone besides the medic?
 Okay. You never gave Nigel a copy of your accident report, did you?
 Our page 59 this is from Claims here in the middle from Mr. Shields. It says:
 Okay. Sir, if someone gets hurt on a Cal Dive vessel —
 — and it is Cal Dive’s fault, you think that Cal Dive should take responsibility?
 And I want to know what “responsibility” means to you because you have got — you have got people’s safety in your hands. Okay. Someone gets hurt on a Cal Dive vessel and it is Cal Dive’s fault, should they take care of the man’s wages while he — if he can’t go back to work?
 They should?
 If he got medical costs and he got hurt on a vessel, Cal Dive — part of taking responsibility takes care of those medical costs, true?
 Okay.
 Someone gets hurt on a Cal Dive vessel, Cal Dive should generally try to make it right, fair?
 (BY MR. LEES) Good afternoon. My name is Jim Lees, and I represent Colton Fluke. You and I have never met before today; is that correct?
 When you took the witness stand, by the way, you were referred to as “Dr.”, is that the way you prefer to be addressed, Dr. Ziegler?
 Okay. You, in fact, have a Bachelor’s Degree?
 And you have a law degree?
 And you attended the University of Pittsburgh Law School for two years, correct?
 And then you left there, correct?
 Because…?
 And just to follow through very briefly on your CV, your educational experience, Texas publishes, through the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, publications identifying those institutions whose degrees are illegal to use in Texas, correct?
 One of the institutions that Texas says is illegal to use a degree from is Kennedy Western University, correct?
 Okay. And you list Kennedy Western University on your CV as a place where you got your M.S. Safety Engineering Courses.
 Didn’t you used to list a degree from there?
 Says here you attended Kennedy Western University from 1994 to 2003?
 So you went to that college for nine years?
 And you were living in Texas at that time?
 And where is Kennedy Western University located?
 Just so I’m clear, then, did you go to Santa Barbara, to the university, and attend there?
 Correspondence course.
 You –huh– You, in your past, have branched out in terms of the things you are willing to offer opinions on, is that fair?
 Well, has a court ever said you weren’t qualified to give an opinion in a court of law in Texas on something you were trying to give an opinion on?
 Well, I may be misinformed, then. I’m looking at an Appellate Opinion from the Fourteenth Court of Appeals, on a case called Memorial Hermann Hospital System –huh– from Harris County, Texas, in which there is reference to an expert witness that has your name, were you involved in that case?
 Says here you were attempting to give an opinion — and I’m reading now from the Appellate Court of Texas —
 — as evidenced by his deposition testimony and accompanying exhibits, Ziegler concluded that Memorial Hermann Hospital System failed to properly select the patient food carts in accordance with the safety concerns for the employees who operate them. You gave a deposition on food carts?
 Attempting to help the lawyers who were suing that hospital, correct?
 It was an OSHA issue?
 According to the appellate court, you had never even seen the food carts, correct?
 You didn’t even know, according to the appellate court, how big the carts were, correct?
 Well, I don’t want you to — to think I’m trying to trick you here, I’ll just read from the appellate opinion. Yet he had not seen the carts in person, he did not know how big the carts were, how much the carts weighed, or how much they could or should carry. He also had no knowledge of the relevant factors in determining whether the weight of a loaded cart or amount of force to be applied to it would be excessive. Yet Ziegler concluded that the hospital failed to properly train its employees in how to operate a food cart. You gave a deposition on that subject?
 And the court said no way.
 You go around a lot and criticize hospitals and companies that they don’t have training programs?
 I’m sure you do. Let me ask you just a few questions about some of the businesses you’ve been in, and again, I may have this wrong, but I just got this off the Secretary of State’s website, says you are or were the registered agent for Rini, R-I-N-I, Design, Incorporated, is that a company you have been or are affiliated with?
 Okay. So that’s your wife’s company.
 Let me go to the next one. Edward Ziegler Racing, Inc., is that anything to do with you?
 What’s that company?
 I see. Is that company still in existence?
 Because it says here in the Secretary of State “forfeited existence” —
 — okay? Do you know why the existence was forfeited?
 Didn’t file the paperwork, franchise taxes, things like that, right?
 No?
 So you didn’t want to keep that company?
 Do you still have a racing company?
 And you race what, cars?
 Vintage race cars. Erebus, E-R-E-B-U-S, Energy, Inc., you’re listed as a registered agent for that company.
 What’s that company about?
 Did you start it?
 Who set it up, when you say “we”?
 Wife and I. And when did you start that oil company?
 That one says “forfeited existence”, correct?
 Did you decide not to pursue that company?
 Experts United, Incorporated, is that a company you’re affiliated with?
 You’re not sure if you have a company called Experts United, Incorporated or not?
 Well —
 You got part of that government money for Halliburton to go do some safety consulting for safety in Iraq, didn’t you?
 And so Experts United, Incorporated is owned by whom?
 Your wife and you. Is that still in existence or not?
 You don’t know?
 I’ll just tell you the Secretary of State says it by the way, okay?
 Okay. Dynamic Marine Engineering, Inc., is that a company you’re affiliated with?
 Used to be?
 What was the purpose of that company?
 Who owned that company?
 You did. That company still in business?
 No. What happened to it?
 You had a welding company, too?
 So you’re also an expert not only in food carts and oil and gas but welding?
 Okay. And I’m sorry, is that company still in existence or not, Dynamic Marine Engineering, Inc.?
 Well, according to the Secretary of State, it says “forfeited existence” —
 — so —
 Probably so.
 How about Rini Florist One, Incorporated, is that a company you’re affiliated with?
 You — It lists you as the registered agent, right?
 Is that one still in business?
 Ziegler Investment Management, Inc., is that one of your companies?
 Says Edward R. Ziegler, list an address on Westheimer in Houston, is that your business address?
 And you don’t recognize Ziegler Investment Management, Inc.?
 Hmm. How about Ziegler slash (Sic) Peru, Inc., does that one ring a bell?
 Who owns your oil company?
 And how long’s the oil company been in business?
 Here’s one City Best Magazine Publishers, Inc., you’re listed as registered agent, any affiliation with that company?
 All right. Is that one still in existence?
 Ziegler Operating Company, does that one ring a bell?
 Is that one still in existence?
 What’s that one do?
 Your original consulting and what?
 So why did you start all of these other ones?
 You kept incorporating different business after different business after different business as I’m looking through the years of your professional life, fair enough?
 Well –huh– Do you have a landscape company, by the way?
 Huh– First Safety Consultants United, Inc., is that one of your companies?
 Pardon me?
 What’s Safety United, is that another company?
 I thought the Ziegler Operating Company was?
 No. Okay. In addition to operating all of these companies at various times — and I know some of them are out of existence, you testify as expert witness a lot?
 Okay. Because you’re kind of busy with this other stuff?
 Well, you’ve testified against a hospital, right?
 Who else have you given opinions against in a court of law or attempted to besides a hospital or in this case you’re talking about Swan, you’re talking about Mr. Graves and EOG, what other kinds of businesses have you given opinions about?
 So you are the guy when it comes to safety in the — the workplace, right?
 I want you to tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury why the hose assembly came apart.
 Okay. Why was Mr. Fluke killed? I’ll bite.
 And so you came all the way from Houston, Texas to tell these people under oath that’s why Tim Fluke was killed, correct?
 You can’t even answer my question as to why that hose came apart?
 Here’s the fitting —
 — here’s the hose. All your expertise, you want to take a look at it and tell me why it came apart.
 (BY MR. LEES) Question stands. Based on your vast expertise, look at it, tell us why did it come apart?
 Wow.
 You know, if he had called in sick that day, with all due respect, he’d be alive today, right?
 There’s a million reasons in hindsight, you can look back and say if, if, if, somebody would be alive today, but God doesn’t give us do-overs, Mr. Ziegler, does he?
 Right. And so if Makena and Bridgeport/Jacksboro had just done it safely, this young man would be alive today, wouldn’t he?
 I’m sure you don’t?
 Good afternoon, sir.
 Could you tell the jury your name.
 And you go by James Perez?
 You are a physician?
 Your medical specialty is what?
 You practice where?
 Tell the jury a little bit about your educational training and background, please.
 Okay. You did – so, did you do a residency in family practice?
 How long was your residency?
 SO, you completed three years of intense training in how to take care of patients that you could see in family practice?
 You heard some witnesses testify as medical students, third year, second year medical students, part of the training was evaluation of chest pain?
 You had that same training; didn’t you?
 And, in fact, you had the same training that Dr. Magorien said that he teaches, and Dr. Duran, and Dr. von Elten say they teach, and they took when they were studying to become family practice doctors?
 That training included, that when you evaluate somebody for chest pain, you look at worst first; Page 8 right?
 That when you’re evaluating somebody for chest pain, you have to consider the aorta?
 That is part of your training; isn’t it?
 You also work at the emergency room at Kit Carson Memorial Hospital; don’t you?
 You have a contract with the hospital to do that?
 Tell the jury about your contract to provide emergency room service at Kit Carson Hospital, when you first entered into that contract, and what it requires?
 Okay. And so, in order to work in the emergency room, you were required to be ACLS certified; weren’t you?
 Can you tell the jury what ACLS stands for?
 You have to actually study the test materials and then take a test?
 You have to be recertified every how many years?
 In addition to — and that is so that you can provide appropriate care for a patient that comes in with chest pain?
 Right. You also had – to become an emergency room doctor, you had to become a ATLS certified?
 And what does “ATLS” stand for?
 And again, there are materials to study, and you studied those materials and took the test, and you are ATLS certified?
 SO, the types of patients that you’ve seen in the emergency room in Burlington include — it is not unusual for you actually to see chest pain patients, is it?
 It is one of the most common presentations, probably after headache, that people are seen for in the emergency room?
 You’ve seen patients coming off the freeway who have been in accidents, trauma patients?
 You see all patients that emergency room doctors see?
 In fact, you believe that the standard of care for diagnosing a patient who presents in the emergency room for chest pain is the same, whether that doctor seeing him is a family practice doctor or an emergency room doctor?
 So, it was fair to have an emergency room doctor come and evaluate your care and testify in this case. That was fair to you; wasn’t it?
 Just as it is fair to have a family practice doctor, or anybody who understands the principles of evaluating a patient with chest pain?
 Part of your job was to be able to recognize signs and symptoms of problems with the aorta, right?
 That was part of your duty to Mr. Epperly and any other patient that comes in with chest pain?
 I want to begin with what is not contested in this case. You admit that Mr. Epperly died from an aortic dissection; don’t you?
 You admit that when you saw Mr. Epperly on September 19, 2003, that he was, in fact, experiencing an aortic dissection?
 You admitted that you done a CT on the 19th, had you ordered a CT examination at the Kit Carson Hospital, more likely than not, Mr. Epperly’s aortic dissection actually would have been diagnosed?
 In fact, you told us that was probable?
 And had that been diagnosed on the 19th, that more likely than not, Mr. Epperly would have survived?
 You also admit that the signs and symptoms that Mr. Epperly presented with — the new onset or acute onset of chest pain that day, and the pain radiating from his chest to his back – that those signs and symptoms that he was telling you about were, in fact, from this aortic dissection that he was experiencing at that time?
 You also admit that had you ordered a CT on the 23d, when you saw him, that more likely than not, the aortic dissection that he had, which started on the 19th, would have been diagnosed?
 And that more likely than not, had you made the diagnosis on the 23d, in the morning when you saw him, that he would have received appropriate care and would have survived?
 I, throughout this case, have used a textbook of medicine called Harrison’s Principles of Medicine. And I represented that this was a textbook you had on your desk in your office?
 Not always on your desk.
 This is a textbook that a reliable authority, in fact, it is one of the basic textbooks of medicine that almost everybody has who practices medicine, family medicine at least?
 You had it in there, because you used it as a reference book?
 And you admit this is the textbook in effect at the time — and this is the 15th Edition, 2001. This was a 2003 case.
 Would you tell the jury why a chest x-ray is insufficient, a chest x-ray is not sufficient to exclude the diagnosis of an aortic dissection?
 You knew that when you saw Mr. Epperly and you ordered the chest x-ray, that that was not the test to run, if you were going to exclude or rule out aortic dissection; didn’t you?
 Now, Mr. Epperly came into your office on the 19th, and he came into your office at the clinic, which is directly across the street from the hospital; isn’t it?
 It is what, 50 feet from the hospital? 50 yards from the hospital?
 When he came in, he didn’t have an appointment?
 This is the first time you ever saw Mr. Epperly; right?
 And when he came in, he reported to your nurse that he had severe chest pain; right?
 Okay. That took him to the top of the list, even though you had other patients who had appointments. Other patients who had scheduled appointments, whether it was days or weeks in advance, Mr. Epperly became the priority; didn’t he?
 And tell the jury why — let me ask you this. When Mr. Epperly presented with chest pain, did he have left arm pain?
 Did he have a report of crushing chest pain? We have heard the classic signs of a heart attack are crushing chest pain, radiating to the left arm. Did he have crushing chest pain, radiating to the left arm?
 Not this classic presentation, crushing chest pain radiating to the left arm?
 Not classic presentation, but consistent with a heart attack?
 So, then, because he complained of chest pain, he goes to the top of the list which means that he was seen before the other patients?
 Is that because when somebody complains of chest pain, it is possible that they may have an immediately life-threatening condition?
 In serious danger or trouble of dying immediately?
 Right?
 Okay. And so, he goes to the top of the list. And when you saw him, you then asked him what his history was; right?
 You learned that he had this sudden onset of pain while he was walking that day?
 Okay.
 Okay. Well, so, then are you saying that because this was new — let me ask you this: What is the difference, Mr. Epperly said he had experienced chest pain that morning, right?
 What time did he experience the chest pain?
 Okay. Well — and was — when you say in the a.m., did it start at 6:00 a.m. and gradually build up, or did you ask him, was this sudden, or was this something that gradually came over several hours?
 So, do you have an answer then as to whether this was sudden? Start, you know, ten minutes ago, and I’m here — started an hour ago, and I’m here. Do you have an answer about whether that was sudden, or did you just know it was new?
 You can’t — you’re not telling the jury, because you didn’t ask the question about whether it was sudden, that you determined it was not sudden?
 Did you ask him?
 Did you ask him whether it was sudden?
 So, as you sit here, you don’t know whether he had a sudden onset of chest pain?
 Okay. So, Mr. Epperly comes in and tells you that he had a new onset of chest pain that started the very morning he came in to see you; right?
 It may have been sudden, you don’t know?
 Okay. And he told you that it was a chest pain, and he told you that it was radiating to his back?
 Not just to his – it was radiating to his mid-back, and to his low back?
 But you wrote chest pain, radiating to the mid-back, and low back pain; right?
 All right. At that point, even though he didn’t have left arm pain, and even though it was not what some folks describe as classic for a heart attack, you immediately hooked him up to an EKG?
 That is because, even though the presentation may not be classic, his presentation fit a patient who may be having a heart attack, and it is important to rule it out as soon as possible; right?
 SO, you gave him an EKG in your office. And the EKG, you interpreted as normal; right?
 And EKG can, if a patient has had a heart attack, show evidence of heart attack on the tracing, true?
 Does it look like little gravestones on the tracing, if somebody has had a heart attack?
 And sometimes it could show ischemic heart disease, by an elevation of something called the ST wave?
 But he had neither. He was a normal presentation on the EKG?
 But that in and of itself does not rule out that he’s either had a heart attack, or that he’s in the process of having a heart attack; does it?
 But not the whole process?
 SO, when he’s in your clinic, you also gave him some, what was it, Maalox or some type of antacid drink?
 You heard Rana Epperly say that he threw that up; is that correct?
 So, he wasn’t feeling good, right?
 You also gave him a shot of Toradol, and it says IM, which means into a muscle.
 But Toradol doesn’t just affect the low back, it is not a drug that says, I’m only going to touch the low back. When you put it in the muscle, it will help if you have pain anywhere.
 In fact, if have you chest pain or mid-back pain, or whatever, the Toradol predictably will diminish pain, wherever it is.
 But the Toradol doesn’t, if the pain subsides, rule out a heart attack; will it?
 I understand that. But the Toradol don’t rule out if he’s having a heart attack?
 But you still have a concern he may have a immediately life-threatening problem?
 You know, have you heard the expression “masking symptoms”?
 With regard to the administration of pain medications, what does that mean?
 One of the great things about the body is, that the pain is a warning sign not just to patients, but also to the doctors, so that they know what to look for?
 One of the things you’re required to do, is not just recognize he’s in pain, but do a history of him and find out where the pain is, whether it is sudden onset, how severe it is, and does it radiate; is that correct?
 You did find out that he had severe pain, and that it was chest, and low back. The low back, you said, was the most severe, and that it radiated to his mid-back; right?
 But are you telling the jury, you didn’t determine whether this was sudden, and that is somehow important to this case?
 But you’re the doctor. You’re the one that understands the significance. He comes in and says: I got this pain this morning, and I’m here, and I’m concerned. That’s basically what he said, right?
 And you’re the doctor. You’re saying that if he had told you it was a sudden onset, that it would have made a big difference. What stopped you from asking him whether it was sudden?
 I understand you don’t have that written down, and you don’t know whether he said sudden or not; but what stopped you from asking him anything?
 But there was no reason that you couldn’t have asked him: Was this sudden?
 You’re saying if you had asked him that question and he said it was sudden — we have no reason to suggest that he wouldn’t have said that because you heard what he said to Rana — all of a sudden, I’m walking down the street, and it felt like I had one of our horses stomp on my chest. Are you telling the jury, if he had said it was sudden, it would have made, in your words, “a big difference”?
 Are you telling the jury that if he had said it was sudden, you would have worked him up for an aortic dissection?
 Let me ask you this question, sir. [You] made the determination that working him up in your clinic was not enough. You had to take him across the street. Did you personally walk him across the street?
 When you got across the street, you took him to the emergency room, and he filled out some forms. Were those filled out before you saw him, or did you go right in?
 Well, there are some hospital record forms that talked about his address and phone number and things like that. Did you go right into the emergency room with him without filling out the forms?
 How quickly was he hooked up to another EKG in the emergency room?
 Then in addition to the EKG — in addition to the EKG, you also administered some blood tests?
 One of the blood tests was a troponin level; is that correct?
 Tell the jury what troponin is, and why you give a patient who you want to exclude heart attack a troponin test?
 Pretty sensitive; isn’t it?
 But sometimes it takes a while for troponin, the troponin test to actually become positive; doesn’t it?
 In fact, what you typically do, if you’re concerned about a heart attack, is administer a troponin test, and even if it is negative, you wait about four hours, and then give those again?
 But you didn’t do that this time, did you?
 When you brought him into the emergency room, you then filled out a history from him; didn’t you?
 Exhibit 50, which you have in the book in front of you, and I have up here, this is the emergency room record, and it says “chest pain”. Is there a specific form that is used in the emergency room when a patient comes in with chest pain?
 SO, there are different forms for different presentations?
 Okay. And it says: Chief complaint chest pain. Did you circle” chest pain”?
 And it says: Started this a.m., is that handwriting?
 Pressure, eight out of ten. Now, is ten — when you explain the pain scale of one to ten, what do you tell patients?
 So, eight out of ten is worst, very severe pain; isn’t it?
 Moderate would be four, five. If ten is the worst pain ever, wouldn’t eight out often be close?
 But the instructions that you give the patient were, zero is no pain, ten is the worst pain ever?
 And so he hit 80 percent of the worst pain ever?
 Now, one thing that happens when you have a heart attack, is you can have shortness of breath, true?
 No diaphoresis. Would you tell the jury what diaphoresis is?
 Plus LBP. That means, he also had low back pain?
 Now, as far as the description of the pain, you have, this is a pressure, eight out of ten was the pain to describe the chest pain radiating to his mid-back; wasn’t it?
 The low back pain, what was that, ten out of ten?
 More severe than an eight?
 He told you this pain was constant, and you checked constant, and it was still present. And then, under location of pain, you drew an arrow, and you drew those boxes; right?
 The boxes are not on the form, you actually drew them on there; didn’t you?
 And you drew a pressure right to the middle of the chest, and right underneath that is the heart, and coming off of the heart, is what?
 You drew a line also to the mid-back, and you wrote the word “radiation” on top?
 And radiation, right through the mid-back and right under that little diagram in the mid-back; is what?
 Then you drew another line to the low back, and does the aorta go under that as well?
 Now, under here you have got, “onset during rest”; is that significant?
 And in fact, if a patient has an aortic dissection, that does not have to happen when they are working out. It could just happen when they are asleep, or at rest, or whatever?
 You put the number eight out often when seen in the emergency department, e.d. It is still eight out of ten, it has not gone down?
 But this is not the nurse, because this is your handwriting?
 Okay. Then the next page of this, which is Page 2, describes the physical exam; right?
 That exam, there are little checkmarks. Did you make those checkmarks’?
 You fill out the EKG monitoring strip, “result NSR” means what?
 That is a normal test, right?
 In fact, you checked off: Reviewed by me, normal sinus rhythm, normal intervals, normal access, normal QRS — which are the Q waves — normal ST segments.
 Then the chest x-ray, you have: Chest x-ray reviewed by me. As I told the jury, you did the initial review of the chest x-ray’?
 And that was normal?
 And KUB, which is another film you ordered,
 And then there was an ultrasound, which was normal?
 The CBC, you read as normal. And then it says, except, and you have this slightly elevated Lipase?
 You do agree, it is only slightly elevated; don’t you?
 All of these other tests. Troponin are normal. KCK, another enzyme to determine if there is any muscle damage. All of those are normal, right?
 Then under clinical impression, it says chest pain, pericardial. And the word “pericardial” means?
 There is a section here for acute aortic dissection, but that’s not circled; is it?
 You do admit, that virtually every textbook of medicine that deals with the evaluation of chest pain, says you must include aortic dissection within the differential, especially when you’re dealing with a middle-aged man; true?
 In this case, we saw the diagram of the aorta, and it is sort of a candy-cane-type figure. If there is an aortic dissection, the pain can, in fact, as you heard from Dr. Magorien, Dr. Duran, and Dr. von Elten, radiate from the chest right to the back; true’?
 You knew when you saw Mr. Epperly, that he had signs and symptoms which were consistent with aortic dissection; didn’t you?
 You knew at the time that Mr. Epperly had this new onset of chest pain that morning, that it was severe, that it radiated to his back; and you knew at that time, that he had signs and symptoms which were consistent with aortic dissection. Whether he had one or not, you didn’t know, but you knew that they were consistent with aortic dissection?
 You didn’t know that?
 In a minute. Do you remember giving a deposition in this case?
 (by Mr. Leventhal) Doctor, I’m going to hand you the original of your deposition.
 (by Mr. Leventhal) This deposition was taken November 14, 2006; do you remember giving that deposition, sir?
 Do you remember that when you gave the deposition, that you were under oath?
 Do you remember that I told you that not only — and you were aware, that not only were you giving a deposition that was being taken down by a court reporter, but you were also videotaped?
 And I told you that if you changed your testimony during the deposition or at trial, that change could be pointed out to the jury, for them to consider whether you were telling the truth?
 I want you to turn — and you also had an opportunity to make corrections to that deposition; didn’t you?
 But you made no corrections, did you?
 I want you to turn to Page 115 of your deposition. I want you to read to yourself from Line 2 through Line 17. Just read that to yourself, quietly. Megan I would like for you to play for the jury, please, Line 2 through Line 17. (Dr. Perez’ Video Deposition and text, from November 14, 2006, was played, from Page 115 Line 2 to Page 115 Line 17, to the jury.)
 (by Mr. Leventhal) That was your testimony, wasn’t it?
 Are you then saying to this jury, that Mr. Epperly told you he had a new onset of chest pain that morning, eight out of ten, radiating to his back, that he did not — is it your testimony now, that he did not have signs and symptoms consistent with aortic dissection when you saw him?
 Now, would you answer my question, sir. Would you like me to repeat it?
 Are you telling the jury when you saw Mr. Epperly, who told you that he had a new onset, maybe sudden, of chest pain, eight out of ten, radiating to his back, that he did not have signs and symptoms consistent with aortic dissection?
 Turn to page 143 of your deposition, please. I want you to look at lines 8 through 12. Read those to yourself. Megan, please, play for the jury Lines 8 through 12.
 That was your testimony at the time under oath, true?
 Now, you took him across the street. You get the EKG. You did the chest x-ray. You did no tests. You did no tests which would have ruled out aortic dissection; true?
 There was a CT Scan in the hospital; wasn’t there? A CT Scanner?
 And if you wanted to order a CT for Mr. Epperly with contrast, that could have been done?
 The only risk to Mr. Epperly, was a very small, as you described it, minimal amount of radiation?
 What would it have taken, a couple of minutes?
 Five minutes?
 SO a five-minute CT Scan, and Mr. Epperly would be alive today, right?
 I have shown you the book which says that the signs and symptoms are consistent, you must rule it out and do it immediately, and that chest x-ray is not enough. But there is almost an identical statement in the ACLS book; isn’t there?
 SO, the ACLS book, let me make sure I get this exactly right. Given Mr. Epperly’s presentation, given his age, and given the fact that he was a smoker, that part of a work-up would be required for you to do, would be to work him up for the possibility of an aortic aneurysm or rupture under the ACLS book, true?
 Actually, what the ACLS book says, for a patient like him, chest pain radiating to the back, they have to be worked up for an aortic aneurysm; that is what it says, doesn’t it?
 But we are not talking about just chest pain radiating to the back. We’re not talking about somebody that has had it for months or years. As you put it 20 minutes ago, if he told you that it was sudden, you would have given him a CAT Scan?
 Basically, what you’re telling the jury is: If you had asked Mr. Epperly, was this sudden? And knowing what you know today, he would have said, yes; he would be alive today.
 Dramatic is an understatement; isn’t it? He would be alive?
 You don’t know whether you asked him. You can’t say sit there and say, he didn’t tell you that it was sudden. All you know, is that you didn’t write it down?
 Do you admit then, if in fact Mr. Epperly told you, in addition to the fact that it started that morning — do you admit to this jury, if he told you that, your care was substandard?
 I get that part. I want to know whether you admit it. You told me, if you got the information that it was a sudden onset of chest pain, that you would have done a CT?
 My question is, sir, if in fact you did get that information, if in fact Mr. Epperly said exactly what he told Rana, when she said that she heard, when she was in the emergency room, it came on while he was walking, felt like a — like his Belgian stepped on his chest. If he told you that and you didn’t do a CT, do you admit to this jury, that your care was substandard?
 So you admit it?
 Yes.
 And do you admit, sir, that because patients who come in, they might not even know what the aorta is. And even if they do, they may not know what is a sign of a problem with the aorta, that was your job, not Mr. Epperly’s job, to ask him if it was sudden.
 But it was your job to ask him, because it was so important to you, it was your job to ask him if it was sudden, not Mr. Epperly’s job to tell you, it’s your job to ask him.
 Do you know why the ACLS was published?
 Actually, it was published, and I believe that these are your words: To provide a certain standard of care for patients. Do you remember saying that?
 Well, but you read it —
 — but–
 One of the purposes, and the main purpose of the ACLS, was so patients’ problems would not be missed. That was one of the reasons, right?
 In fact your word was: It gives you a standard, your words, a standard to follow.
 And the reason for that is so that patients’ problems would not be missed; right?
 That’s one of the reasons for the ACLS guidelines?
 And in fact it provides a standard approach for patients who present with certain signs and symptoms; doesn’t it?
 And what it does, it takes away the judgment of the physician, so that the patient can’t say — so the physician can’t say, yes, he has chest pain. He has pain radiating down his arms, and all of these problems, but in m)! judgment, it is not a heart attack, it is something else. The ACLS took away that judgment to make sure that physicians weren’t missing a problem, true?
 My question, sir, was: The ACLS took away the judgment, to make sure that physicians were not missing a problem; true?
 Turn to Page 114, please, of your deposition. I’m sorry, Page 111. On Page 111 I asked you virtually the same questions that I asked you now.
 You looked at the chest x-ray and you read it as normal. You didn’t have a radiologist in the hospital at the time that you looked at the chest x-ray, did you?
 What is the situation with radiologists at Kit Carson, if you need one to read a film STAT, or immediately, what do you do?
 SO, this was a Friday. September 19 was a Friday, and you didn’t digitize it or try to scan it and send it over the internet?
 Okay. But you did discharge Mr. Epperly–
 — on the 19th. And you heard Mrs. Epperly tell the jury, that Mr. Epperly didn’t want to go home?
 He never said anything, it feel like I’m dying, or there is something wrong; he didn’t use those words?
 You heard Mrs. Epperly say and it is in her posting fourteen days, or thirteen days after Mr. Epperly’s death, you told them this was not life threatening, or words to that affect, and that she heard you say that at least three times. Do you admit saying that to them?
 Then you think that you probably did say that because that is what she wrote?
 Given the fact that aortic dissection is within the differential, you didn’t put it in, but you admit it would be, how do you tell somebody it is not life threatening before you do a CT Scan?
 One of the reasons you don’t want to look at things in hindsight, you don’t want to be faced with a misdiagnosis which costs a patient their life; right?
 One of the reasons for the rules, if the signs and symptoms are consistent with aortic dissection, you must work it up so that you don’t wind up looking at something in hindsight and saying, Oh, no. Oh, my God. I missed it. That is the purpose of the rule, to be sure that don’t happen; right?
 It is actually only perfect if the doctor follows the rule. But if he breaks the rule, things like this happen; true?
 But not in this case. Because if you had followed the rule which says, that if the patient’s history or examination is consistent with aortic dissection, the imaging studies to evaluate the patient must be pursued; if you had done that and you had done the CT, he would be alive?
 On Monday, the 22d, you met with Dr. Harrington?
 Was there typically a radiologist there on a Friday?
 You met with Dr. Harrington, who actually came in, drove in to do a shift at Kit Carson?
 How many days a week would she do that?
 Dr. Harrington and you discussed the x-ray. Tell the jury what Dr. Harrington said to you about the x-ray?
 You also knew that it could be a normal variant in an older person, but for someone Mr. Epperly’s age, it would be unusual for the aorta to look tortuous?
 Was my statement true?
 That you knew, on September 22, 2003, that it was not unusual for an aorta to look tortious in an older person, older than 41, someone in their 60s to 70s; but that it was unusual, may still be within a normal range, but it was unusual for it to look tortuous in a41-year-old?
 You said that you presented the case to her. Did you give her the medical record to review?
 So, you didn’t have the medical records when she was doing this. She would just have your verbal presentation?
 Did you document what you told her anywhere?
 And what did you tell her?
 Is that your best recollection of what you told her?
 SO, is it correct that she didn’t see the diagram which shows the chest pain radiating to the back?
 Was my statement correct?
 What you told her was, this was a 41 -year-old man with chest pain, but you didn’t tell her about the back pain?
 Do you know whether you told her about the back pain?
 Do you know?
 Actually, you don’t know whether you said back pain or not, just like you don’t know whether you said this is not life threatening to the Epperlys. It’s a long time.
 Did you tell Dr. Harrington that Mr. Epperly did not have health insurance?
 In fact, you have no recollection of telling, no reason to have told Dr. Harrington that Mr. Epperly didn’t have health insurance; did you?
 I’m not asking that. I’m not asking whether it would affect the decision. I’m asking you whether you concede that there was no reason for you to tell the radiologist that this man did not have insurance?
 You never had a discussion with Mr. Epperly where he said, I don’t want to pay for expensive tests; did you?
 That is clear in your mind. He never said, I don’t want the CT Scan, I don’t want tests, because I can’t afford them. Those words or anything like it never came out of his mouth, true?
 You were aware when Dr. Harrington told you that it appears tortuous, that it means that it may be a little unusual; right?
 You knew that one reason that a patient can have an aorta that appears to be kind of twisted, or unusual, is an aortic dissection?
 So, you knew when you saw him, saw Mr. Epperly, when you were talking to Dr. Harrington, that signs and symptoms which were consistent with an aortic aneurysm, or problems with the aorta. You knew that. The doctor is telling you, the radiologist is telling you, that the aorta looks tortious. And that can happen when there is dissection. You knew that. You didn’t need her to tell you to do an additional study. That was your job; true?
 You did not know what?
 I’m sorry, you misunderstood me. I apologize if it was not clear. Let me restart. When you were talking to Dr. Harrington, you knew that Mr. Epperly had signs and symptoms that would have been consistent with an aortic dissection — you didn’t know he had one — but you knew that he fell within the general differential; right?
 I want you to, if you would please, turn to Page 142 of your deposition. I want you to read to yourself Page 142 Line 6, through Page 144 Line 6. Megan, would you please play for the jury Page 142 Line 6 through Page 144 Line 6.
 So, you’re not blaming Dr. Harrington for the misdiagnosis; are you?
 — or indirectly. It was your job to put it together. It was your job to recognize and put this whole picture together. She pointed out the tortuosity. It was your job to determine what to do with it. It was not her fault; is it?
 She didn’t need to. As I had pointed out, she didn’t need to make those recommendations. You knew that a CT was the only way to rule it out; right?
 You knew that. You didn’t need her to tell you that, right?
 You knew the signs and symptoms of an aortic dissection. You didn’t need her to tell you that?
 Correct?
 You knew that after she told that you the aorta looked different for a 41-year-old man, tortuous, you knew it could be aortic dissection, you didn’t need her to tell you that; right?
 I have shown the jury this on several occasions, but these are your words; aren’t they? Even if there is just a chance that someone may have a life-threatening condition, you want to rule that out, so that they don’t die while you’re thinking it may be something else; right? And you said, Correct. That is the standard of care, isn’t it? Answer: That is the way that you approach patients. Those were your words, weren’t they?
 At the beginning of this trial, the Court read an instruction for the jury. Bear with me for a moment. I want to get a copy of that. It set forth your position in this case, in the instructions, and I’m asking the Court to take judicial notice of that, because it is now part of the trial.
 (by Mr. Leventhal) It says, although Dr. Perez did consider an aortic dissection, based upon Mr. Eppley’s presentation, the probability of this diagnosis was not sufficient to warrant additional testing. That’s your official position in this case, now, can you tell me how you take that position, and at the same time say, even if there is — or agree, that even if there is just a chance that someone may have a life-threatening condition, you want to rule that out so they don’t die, while you’re thinking that it may be something else. The probability was not high enough? But if there is chance they may have it, you rule it out. They just don’t fit; do they?
 Doctor, it is a little late to correct the statement, because it became part of the case when it was read to the jury. It is your official position in this case. So, tell the jury, by percentages, what the probability was. Was it 10 percent? Was it 20 percent? We have heard probability when we talked earlier with the jury, that probability begins at 51 percent. What was the probability that Mr. Epperly was having an aortic dissection when you saw him, that was not high enough to justify a five-minute CT? Two percent, five percent, ten percent, what was it?
 That’s true of any patient, even with classic signs and symptoms; right?
 In fact, the books that we provide are all chest pain patients, not chest pain patients with radiation to the back, not chest pain patients when you start limiting it down to a 41-year-old man. Do you know what this probability was for him?
 But you do admit that there was a chance?
 I’m not talking about always. I’m not talking about the situation where one of these people here, there is always a chance they may be in the process of having an aortic dissection, or I might be. I’m talking about a person that presents with a new onset of chest pain — as he described it, sudden, radiating to his back, right where the aorta is — that person, certainly at the minimum, had a chance that they were in the process of suffering an aortic dissection; true?
 So, when you, given your admission, and given your statement in the deposition, that the standard of care is to rule it out so that they don’t die while you’re thinking it is something else, and you didn’t do that, you admit to the jury that your care, because there was a chance that this man was having an aortic dissection, given his presentation, that because you didn’t rule it out, don’t you admit that your care was substandard, truthfully?
 We heard, and there was a discussion during jury selection, that a doctor can exercise his judgment; but he shouldn’t do that until after he does all of the tests. You exercised your judgment before you got the CT; didn’t you?
 That was before you got the critical tests?
 Yes.
 So, you took away any chance of finding out whether Mr. Epperly had this life-threatening problem, by making the decision for him, without telling him, without giving him the option that he shouldn’t have a CT; right?
 His history did not rule out an aortic aneurysm; did it?
 Did his history rule out aortic aneurysm?
 What part of the history makes it less of a probability? He says, I have this chest pain radiating to my back, it came on this morning. Even if he didn’t say that it was sudden, and there was good evidence that he did. Even if he didn’t say it was sudden, what part of that reduces the chance that it is not an aortic dissection or aneurysm?
 It was relentless — it never went away. It was constant in your office. It was the same at the hospital. It was the same four days later.
 Doctor, when he was in the hospital and you said that it improved, you had just given him Toradol; correct?
 But you gave it, and he came in on Tuesday, you’re saying it was improved. Let’s see what you wrote for Tuesday. Let’s go to Page 25 — Exhibit 25, Page 8, please. This is the note that you dictated at that time, right?
 Within minutes of seeing him?
 So you write, patient presents today for follow-up on his chest pain. Since his last visit, he continues with the pain, pretty much constant. There all of the time. It does not worsen or improve. Activity does not make it any worse. Can you show me where in the note it says that it is the same improved chest pain that it was after — when he left the emergency room?
 I didn’t ask you that, sir. It says, is the same. Right? You would assume the same as when he left the emergency room, not the same as when he had the first encounter on Friday. Did you ask him to rate the chest pain on a scale of one to ten’!
 So, did you ask him, and the chest pain was eight out of ten, because he said it is the same. Are you saying, that if he had said it was the same, you would have done a CT?
 I have a question about that. I have a question. If a chest x-ray, which is a radiographic study that looks into the chest, right in the area where the aorta is, is not sufficient to rule out an aortic dissection; how can you claim that by looking at him, that you can make the decision that he didn’t have an aortic dissection?
 Are you telling the jury that because he was improved, you decided not to do a CT? Because that’s what you told us in your deposition. You saw a man who comes in that morning, says: Follow-up on chest pain. Since his last visit continues with the pain, pretty much constant. There all of the time. Are you saying because he looked improved, which you didn’t note, that you decided not to do a CT?
 Turn to Exhibit 1, Page 20 for me, please.
 Doctor, that is the note that you dictated after Mr. Epperly died. At this point, you knew you had missed an aortic dissection.
 You knew you had missed it. That was what was going on the whole time. You knew you missed it, and you wrote this note.
 And it was your opportunity to document that, not only what you saw, but your reason for not working him up, not doing the CT; right?
 Part of this note — would you enlarge the bottom part for the jury, please. Says: I saw him as a follow-up again today in the clinic. I noted that he was doing about the same, no worse, no better. He had taken it easy over the weekend, not really doing much activity. He had cut back on his coffee intake. He had been drinking 20 pots of coffee a day, and cut back down to 2 cups. There were no overall significant changes. That was dictated the night that he died.
 When you dictated that, you didn’t write in there that he was improved from when you first saw him, did you?
 The 20 pots of coffee a day, you’re not claiming the reason that you failed to do a CT Scan, was because he had this history of coffee intake; are you?
 Do you agree when you have a person like this, that about 50 percent of the time, only about 50 percent of the time, there is a description of this tearing pain when there is an aortic dissection; is that your understanding of the literature?
 You knew that in 2003, just because you don’t have a history that the patient had tearing pain, does not mean that they are not having an aortic dissection; you knew that, didn’t you?
 So, you’re not going to claim — you’re not going to say that because he didn’t have tearing pain, that was an excuse for not doing a CT, that is not going to be your defense, right?
 Is that the reason that you didn’t do a CT?
 But you knew that 50 percent of the patients will have no tearing pain. In fact, Doctor, after you saw Mr. Epperly, and after he died, you saw a man who just had chest pain, no back pain, and you decided to send him for a CT, and what did you find?
 And that not only didn’t have tearing pain, he didn’t have pain radiating to his back; right?
 And that man, who you saw after Mr. Epperly, he had a history of connective tissue disease, and didn’t have the tearing pain, didn’t have radiation to his back; but because there was a chance he may have an aortic dissection, you sent him for CT, it was identified, and he survived; true?
 Mr. Epperly was a smoker, doesn’t that increase the risk of aortic dissection?
 You’re not claiming because he was a smoker, that is somehow an excuse for not doing a CT’?
 The approach to a patient is a step-by-step approach; is it not?
 And the first thing that you do, is rule out heart disease, heart attack; right?
 You were aware that an EKG generally will not rule out aortic dissection; correct?
 But sometimes, an EKG will reveal an aortic dissection, if the dissection starts at the aortic valve, coronary artery?
 (by Mr. Leventhal) Doctor, I want to clarify one thing. That is, this chest pain, back pain that was eight out of ten refers to the chest pain and mid-back pain. The pain was higher than eight out often?
 He had mid-back pain, eight out of ten, and chest pain eight out of ten, and low back pain higher?
 Can I ask that the court reporter make a note of this part of the transcript. I’m going to ask you to do something later with this. Doctor, you said that his history was not consistent with aortic dissection; do you recall him saying that?
 And then you told us the thing that was missing, was sudden onset. If this were present, it would have made it consistent?
 Now, you also told us that you give a lot of weight and a lot of credibility to the posting that Rana Epperly did on October 3, 2003, because it was within 13 or 14 days after Mr. Epperly’s death?
 I have Exhibit 66 up, and it says — and this is an exhibit that is going to the jury — that on Friday, September 19, my husband left the house to run some errands in town. At 11 :00 a.m., I received a call from our doctor, stating that John had come into the office about chest pain, and he was being admitted to the ER for further tests. He told me, upon arrival, that it felt as if he had been kicked in the chest by one of our Belgian horses (large drafts weighing over one ton.) Had excruciating back pain, numb big toe, was dizzy, and saw stars. You saw that, didn’t you, and heard her say that?
 And that was consistent with sudden onset of chest pain; isn’t it?
 That was not the description. The description was: He felt as if he had been kicked. So, assume for a moment that this is consistent with the sudden onset of chest pain, okay?
 When Mr. Epperly came into the emergency room, he didn’t know what tests he needed; did he?
 He didn’t know that he needed another EKG?
 That was your decision?
 He didn’t know that he needed a blood test?
 That was your decision?
 He didn’t know what to test in the blood? He didn’t know that the enzymes needed to be tested, right?
 That was your decision?
 If the enzyme had been positive, it would have shown that he was in the process of having a heart attack, right?
 SO, when you’re going through and determining whether his presentation is consistent with a heart attack, you were the one who knows what information is critical to determine what is consistent and what is inconsistent, right?
 Not just takes the history, but orders the tests?
 SO, you have no reason to believe that John Epperly had any medical knowledge of what was important or unimportant in evaluating either his heart or his aorta; true?
 And so, isn’t it true, Doctor, that if the turning point of this whole case, the turning point of whether to do a CT Scan, is whether this is sudden, that it was your responsibility, your duty, to ask the question; isn’t that true?
 Just like it was your duty, your responsibility to order the troponin, and if you had not ordered the troponin, if you were to come to court, and this was a heart attack case, and you said that his history was not consistent, because he didn’t have a positive troponin, but I didn’t order it, that would be substandard care; wouldn’t it?
 Just like in this case, by not asking Mr. Epperly whether this was sudden, and you have no reason to believe that he wouldn’t have told you that it was sudden, right? I think that probably, if this is the history, he’s walking down the street, and he has a sudden onset of chest pain, if you would have asked him, he would have said it was sudden, true?
 Probably would have. There is no reason to hold that back. He’s in there, he’s letting you stick holes in his arm, take x-rays, he’s letting you hook him up to EKG; if you asked him a simple question, and said: Was this sudden? He probably would have told you that it was sudden.
 So, isn’t it true, doctor, and don’t you admit to this jury, by not asking the question, by not finding out that this was sudden — which is a life or death question in this case — that care was substandard? Don’t you really admit that, sir?
 Don’t you admit, because you didn’t ask the question, and because your whole decision on whether to do this CT was based upon that question, don’t you really admit, that in this case, that since that question was so important, and because the answer was likely going to be, it was sudden, that that reflects substandard care on your part; isn’t that true?
 Is it the history that, in your mind —
 — is so important, about whether or not to do the CT. So, had you asked the question as you now admit that you were required to do, and you probably would have gotten the answer that it was sudden, it was substandard care, and cost this man his life; true?
 So, you agree with me, that your failure to ask the question, cost Mr. Epperly his life, and that was substandard care?
 And that was substandard care, true?
 Do you admit then, if in fact Mr. Epperly told you, in addition to the fact that it started that morning — do you admit to this jury, if he told you that, your care was substandard?
 My question is, sir, if in fact you did get that information, if in fact Mr. Epperly said exactly what he told Rana, when she said that she heard, when she was in the emergency room, it came on while he was walking, felt like a — like his Belgian stepped on his chest. If he told you that and you didn’t do a CT, do you admit to this jury, that your care was substandard?
 So you admit it?
 Yes.
 So, when you, given your admission, and given your statement in the deposition, that the standard of care is to rule it out so that they don’t die while you’re thinking it is something else, and you didn’t do that, you admit to the jury that your care, because there was a chance that this man was having an aortic dissection, given his presentation, that because you didn’t rule it out, don’t you admit that your care was substandard, truthfully?
 So, isn’t it true, doctor, and don’t you admit to this jury, by not asking the question, by not finding out that this was sudden — which is a life or death question in this case — that care was substandard? Don’t you really admit that, sir?
 Don’t you admit, because you didn’t ask the question, and because your whole decision on whether to do this CT was based upon that question, don’t you really admit, that in this case, that since that question was so important, and because the answer was likely going to be, it was sudden, that that reflects substandard care on your part; isn’t that true?
 Is it the history that, in your mind —
 — is so important, about whether or not to do the CT. So, had you asked the question as you now admit that you were required to do, and you probably would have gotten the answer that it was sudden, it was substandard care, and cost this man his life; true?
 So, you agree with me, that your failure to ask the question, cost Mr. Epperly his life, and that was substandard care?
 And that was substandard care, true?
 Do you admit then, if in fact Mr. Epperly told you, in addition to the fact that it started that morning — do you admit to this jury, if he told you that, your care was substandard?
 My question is, sir, if in fact you did get that information, if in fact Mr. Epperly said exactly what he told Rana, when she said that she heard, when she was in the emergency room, it came on while he was walking, felt like a — like his Belgian stepped on his chest. If he told you that and you didn’t do a CT, do you admit to this jury, that your care was substandard?
 So you admit it?
 Yes.
 So, when you, given your admission, and given your statement in the deposition, that the standard of care is to rule it out so that they don’t die while you’re thinking it is something else, and you didn’t do that, you admit to the jury that your care, because there was a chance that this man was having an aortic dissection, given his presentation, that because you didn’t rule it out, don’t you admit that your care was substandard, truthfully?
 So, isn’t it true, doctor, and don’t you admit to this jury, by not asking the question, by not finding out that this was sudden — which is a life or death question in this case — that care was substandard? Don’t you really admit that, sir?
 Don’t you admit, because you didn’t ask the question, and because your whole decision on whether to do this CT was based upon that question, don’t you really admit, that in this case, that since that question was so important, and because the answer was likely going to be, it was sudden, that that reflects substandard care on your part; isn’t that true?
 Is it the history that, in your mind —
 — is so important, about whether or not to do the CT. So, had you asked the question as you now admit that you were required to do, and you probably would have gotten the answer that it was sudden, it was substandard care, and cost this man his life; true?
 So, you agree with me, that your failure to ask the question, cost Mr. Epperly his life, and that was substandard care?
 And that was substandard care, true?
 Sir, you agree that your job is to be objective?
 You are not, it wouldn’t be appropriate for you to cherry pick certain little pieces of evidence from the record and ignore other things that just inconveniently don’t fit with your opinion. Right?
 It wouldn’t be right, would it?
 It wouldn’t be right to misread things in the record and draw inappropriate conclusions from them, would it?
 Let’s start with the MRI business. Actually let me start first with this: We’ve got a stack, where is the other, we’ve got a stack of the University of Virginia records for the first two months of this baby’s life. You went through all of them?
 And they were important to you in forming your opinions?
 So you pretty much relied on all of them to a greater or lesser extent.
 And relied on them as well?
 Okay. So the opinion about the MRI, now, let me ask you preliminarily, is that your deposition that I see in front of you?
 Okay. So you’ve looked at it recently?
 To prepare for today?
 Did you see any errors in there?
 Kind of embarrassing ones, weren’t they?
 Okay. Well, one error is that you are totally changing your opinion on the MRI. True?
 Well, sir, in your deposition you told us, let me show you what you said.
 I will get there in one second, 53. Question and answer, “What is it about the report of the scan that causes you to think this was consistent with an infarct rather than an hypoxic ischemic event?” Here is your answer. By the way, today you are saying yes, it is an hypoxic ischemic event. Correct?
 At the deposition completely the opposite. Right?
 Let’s just finish, this. Okay?
 Answer, “Well, I think it was the description of the MRI being in the parietal occipital area. And again, in my experience as a neonatologist, if there had been an asphyxial event prior to delivery and in the hours prior to delivery, there would be more of a global insult rather than a discrete insult in the parietal occipital area. In my experience in the severely asphyxiated baby, for whatever reason, the hypoxic ischemic damage is all over the brain rather than confined to one particular area, as it is in this case in the parietal occipital area.”
 Okay. The jury yesterday saw MRI images that showed damage all over this baby’s brain. You are aware of that?
 Did Mr. Peake tell you that?
 So he told you, now we have got to move off of that opinion about there being focal injury.
 You realize that there is absolutely no support now. And in fact, it is a little embarrassing for you to stick with what you said before about a focal injury to this baby rather than a global injury consistent with loss of oxygen due to loss of blood. True?
 You had all of these.
 No. I am talking about the University of Virginia records.
 You just misread the report.
 Within the University of Virginia records, if you had looked at them carefully, you could have seen that the pediatric neurologists who were taking care of this baby all saw that this was an injury on the MRI that looked like oxygen deprivation from low blood flow. Didn’t you see that, sir?
 Well, did you see that before you formed this opinion that that was wrong?
 Let me show you what I am talking about here. Way too many pieces of paper here. University of Virginia, page 249, neuro consult after the MRI. All of these records were available to you a long time ago, before you gave your deposition. MRI with bilateral, BL. Posterior medial infarcts, extensive. Probably, two zeros means secondary to or caused by, right?
 Probably caused by anoxia low flow. That is low blood flow. Right?
 And so when you are changing your opinion today about this MRI report, and it is solely on your reading of this report which you’ve already admitted that you messed up once, now you are telling us that somewhere in this report it tells us the timing of the injury conveniently was before the amniocentesis. That’s what you are trying to say.
 You are not allowed to talk about what other experts say. You know that. You know the rules of court. You have been around this track many times. But let me ask you this, though. Did you happen to read Dr. Zimmerman, the defense neuroradiologist?
 He said there was a range of time. You don’t remember that?
 So in your deposition, you gave us no opinion about the timing of this injury based on this MRI report. True?
 Sir, you were asked the basis of your opinions while you thought that this baby had some injury that preceded the amniocentesis, weren’t you?
 Sure. And the timing here is it could have been November 5th from the MRI because it is imprecise. True?
 Okay. But if it could have been November 5th and it could have been November 2nd, then it doesn’t matter, does it?
 We will get to that. But at least with the MRI you got to admit it is a tie ball game.
 Show me where in this MRI report it says anything about the timing of the injury.
 But something you made up?
 Didn’t you try to tell this jury on direction examination that this MRI supported the opinion that the injury occurred before the amniocentesis?
 Now you are saying it could maybe not support it.
 Let’s stick with one thing at a time. Okay? Now, let’s talk about cherry picking. On the newborn record, and you told us about, you know, mild to moderate resuscitation. You left out one thing, didn’t you? What was this baby’s oxygen saturation on room air after she had had half an hour of oxygen and after she had had the bag valve mask?
 Well, the jury heard yesterday from the nursery nurse that they removed the baby just quickly from oxygen to see what her saturation would be on room air; and that’s appropriate. Right?
 Just quickly.
 And in fact, it was at 7:45 p.m. it was 37 to 45 percent saturation. Correct?
 If she had stayed on room air, she would have died.
 Not compatible with life to have an oxygen saturation of 37 to 45 percent.
 Sheer speculation.
 It is sheer speculation that this baby had a 37-percent oxygen saturation only because the machine wasn’t working.
 Oh, and she was hypovolemic. You left that totally out of your opinion, didn’t you?
 Well, hypovolemic, low blood volume, they had to pump her up repeatedly. Right?
 More than two.
 In fact, she couldn’t hold up her blood pressure after the first two and so that is why Dr. Stickley bolused her again.
 She had a low blood pressure.
 That is not consistent with an injury two or three days earlier, is it, sir?
 You are saying that a baby has failed to, and you know the concept that we all do, if we bleed and we don’t get a transfusion, our blood vessels suck up the fluid.
 The interstitial fluid, and restore volume.
 They do that within hours?
 Several hours. And by the time passage of several hours, it is usually a normal amount of volume. True?
 One of the reasons you said in your deposition that you thought the resuscitation was essentially no big deal was that you said the baby was happy after all of this. Do you remember that?
 Actually what you, you mentioned it twice. I am going to show you what you said.
 You relied, in part, on the fact that this was a quote, happy baby, didn’t you?
 Can you just answer the question?
 “Baby was described after the resuscitative efforts as, quote, being happy. The resuscitation was relatively uneventful. The baby only required some positive pressure ventilation for two or three minutes and some oxygen and responded very well.”
 Okay. And here is what the record says on who was happy. This is the newborn record with the Apgars that we have looked at. There is a section in just about any newborn record on the subject of bonding. Right, sir?
 Bonding is mom and baby, dad and baby bonding together?
 It is psychologically very important?
 And that is why you document it. If you had a mom in there who had no interest in the baby, they might want to call Social Services or whatever, and you know, get some involvement. Right?
 So bonding here, length of time two to three minutes. Persons present, father of baby. Response to infant, happy. That is what you misread.
 Okay. You said that it was important to understand the cause of a child’s injury in order to develop a treatment plan.
 If there has been recent loss of volume that hasn’t yet stabilized, the doctors would be more concerned about giving fluid and then eventually maybe blood transfusions as opposed to a remote event.
 And in this case you have already told us that one of the things that was important to you or that you relied on was the baby’s assessment when she got to the University of Virginia. True?
 You looked, didn’t you, for some doctor in the record who would support your opinion that this mother had had some previous bleeding in her detachment of her placenta and that that caused all of this baby’s problems. You looked, didn’t you?
 Yeah. Actually you totally misread that one, too. Let me show you what the admission assessment was of David Kaufman. Do you know who Dr. Kaufmann is, David Kaufman?
 He is a neonatologist at the University of Virginia.
 Let’s look at what he said.
 The single most important record that you would want to see to see contemporaneously what people thought at the time would be the admission assessment because down the road, you know, information gets distorted and people change what they, you have seen that before, you go back to the core source.
 The admission assessment is an important piece of data. Correct?
 Let’s stay on subject now. The admission assessment, University of Virginia, the little girl has been helicoptered there after this, you know, you claim mild to moderate resuscitation event. She did need intensive care, you admit that.
 And Dr. Stickley was right to send her to the University of Virginia.
 So Dr. Kaufman’s assessment, this is so early in the case that they don’t have Marissa’s name on there. That is a typical thing, you say “Baby Girl Simpson”?
 November 6th, 2001, “I have reviewed the history, discussed the perinatal history.” Perinatal means the events surrounding the birth. Right?
 “And current condition of the baby with the referring physician Dr. Stickley. Arrange the neonatal transport, discuss transport management with the transport clinician. Examined the baby myself, reviewed the following tests,” and he refers to arterial blood gas. Correct?
 Hematocrit, HCT?
 Complete blood count?
 Electrolytes?
 And chest x-ray. “This is a 2977 gram baby.” That is the same as 6 pounds 9 ounces. I only know that because I had a cheat sheet.
 “2977 gram baby born 37 weeks of gestation. This is 37-week AGA infant.” That AGA means appropriate for gestational age. Right?
 And that means she is not big, not small, in a good range, in an appropriate range.
 “Delivered by stat C-section after complication of acute blood loss from amniocentesis when needle came in contact with placenta.” You saw that Dr. Kaufman wrote that?
 And you rejected it?
 You know more than Dr. Kaufman knew at the time?
 I am going to ask you to point it out for me since it is so important to you. Do you have it?
 “At C-section amniotic fluid was noted to be grossly bloody.” You knew that. Right?
 Okay. How did that amniotic fluid get to be grossly bloody, by the way?
 Interesting. So now you agree that the fluid was bloody in the amniotic sac because of the amniocentesis.
 How does that work?
 I am talking anatomically. How does that work?
 Right.
 But how did the old blood get into an intact amniotic sac? That is my question.
 Okay. I will get back to that in a minute. Let me finish this. So he talks about the baby’s condition, and we don’t need to go through all of that. Infant, the, what they did to revive the baby, maternal history. Here is the physical exam he is talking about, color is pale, there is good perfusion. It says the baby is still pale many hours after birth. Right?
 Well, you don’t have anything to contradict it, do you?
 He is looking for birth defects and he doesn’t see any birth defects. Right?
 He writes down what the issues are and under perinatal compromise, “Mild to moderate, bloody amniotic fluid after amniocentesis with anemic child requiring fluid resuscitation for hypotension.” Right?
 So his gestalt on the whole case was that the child got anemia from the amnio and that is why she needed the fluid resuscitation at birth because she had low blood pressure.
 A normal reading of that is that, and your reading of that is that the child developed anemia from the bleeding from the amnio. That is why she needed the fluid resuscitation because she had low blood pressure at birth.
 Okay.
 Go ahead.
 But then that gives you zero explanation for why the baby needed fluid resuscitation at birth because she had a low tank of gas.
 You already told us that it only takes hours to restore from the interstitial fluids.
 Days?
 So you don’t know what happens in utero so it is just pure speculation?
 All right. So, you are saying he is just wrong?
 And then on his second page he talks about his plans, and the second item he puts is “Anemia, acute blood loss after amniocentesis, hematocrit 27 at birth, monitor hematocrit with transfusions if clinically indicated.” Right?
 I’ve got dozens of pages to show you that talk about the amniocentesis.
 I will let you do that at the break. We will let you do that at the break. Let’s see. This reminds me of one other thing. You said you, as a neonatologist, would get involved in counseling moms who have difficult birth situations. Right?
 And even after birth?
 And so did anybody ever counsel Marsha Simpson, We think you had a placental abruption and it could increase the risk for a future baby problem?
 It didn’t happen, did it?
 There are two options on it not happening, the counseling. One is these guys derelicted their —
 Okay. So let’s talk about the —
 You had a chance to go out in your car and check the records?
 And the record that you found that had the most information about a possible placental abruption is this one here?
 That radiology thing was just a brief note, and you couldn’t tell if it was history or what it was. Right?
 It wasn’t an evaluation of anybody’s placenta?
 Now, on this note here you are relying on this top part here?
 Well, let’s take a quick look at it. We are doing this as the Judge said, just to get the basis of whether you have a good basis for your opinions. The part you circled there, let’s talk a little bit about how these consultation requests were. This is a request from a, whoever that is in the upper left corner, the requesting physician. Right?
 To the consultant service, it looks like pediatric neurology maybe?
 The fact that there is a number here, 6197, that is usually a designation that the requesting physician who has written the top part is a resident in training. True?
 Well, in any event, what you are relying on is this part here that says, “Reason for consultation, requests 37-week infant born by crash C-section secondary to abruption during amniocentesis with likely anoxia-related”
 “Anoxia-related seizures and clinical evidence of ATD,” that is that acute tubular necrosis, the kidney damage. Right?
 That is referring to some kidney valves?
 The BUN and creatinine?
 Now, what the consultant wrote, I guess you have not paid attention to?
 What the consultant wrote was, “Infant was delivered by crash C-section at outside hospital after suffering acute blood loss during when amniocentesis needle came in contact with placenta. At delivery amniotic fluid was grossly bloody and infant was pale and floppy. Apgar is 5, 5, and 9.” So in terms of whether this record really helps you to support your opinion that other people were thinking about the possibility of a placental defect, it is kind of a tie ball game, isn’t it?
 Sure. But the, and even with, even what both of them said is they are not talking about a remote event, they are talking about an event after an amniocentesis.
 Right. Now, let’s go to the reasons that you said about this being a prior detachment or abruption of the placenta. Okay?
 Now, the first reason you gave us on your list of reasons, if I remember right, was that the —
 Okay. So this reason number one that you gave us was you were relying on evidence that Mrs. Simpson, the weekend before the Monday morning amniocentesis, had cramping pain.
 Okay. You got that from Dr. Roberts. True?
 Mrs. Simpson testified both in her deposition and at trial that she had back pain but no cramping pain over that prior weekend. Were you aware of that?
 And you saw in the record of November 5th, the record of the amniocentesis, that it mentioned that immediately after the amniocentesis she has cramping back pain.
 And she testified that she had huge cramping pain right after that amniocentesis. I will just ask you to accept that, you can imagine.
 Okay. So if she didn’t have cramping pain the prior weekend, that would undercut one of the key bases of your opinion.
 We are talking about cramping pain was what you said you were relying on. Now you are changing it to back pain?
 Women get back pain all the time late in pregnancy. They are carrying around a heavy baby.
 Even if she had no cramping pain?
 So any woman who has back pain late in pregnancy — well, skip that. Now, let’s talk about the anatomy of a placental abruption and where it happens. Let me do my own little diagram. This will probably be somewhat laughable, but here is the question I want to ask you. As I understand the anatomy, and you correct me if I am wrong, here we’ve got an amniotic sac and we have a baby inside here. And we’ve got an umbilical cord that connects up here to a placenta which is outside the amniotic sac. Right?
 And then when these blood vessels or when the umbilical cord leaves the amniotic sac, by the way, there is a tight connection, otherwise the mom would be leaking amniotic fluid all the time. Right?
 So what happens is everything kind of fans out in terms of blood vessels and we’ve got, up here we’ve got the mom’s uterus, and actually the uterus should be in a tight connection with the placenta. It has to be for life. Correct?
 What happens in the placental abruption is on the mom’s side, you’ve got baby’s side next to the amniotic sac. You have got the mom’s side next to the uterus. Right?
 Let me show you, this is a little better. So this connection right here, here we’ve got the placenta being in tight connection with the uterus, which is necessary for the baby.
 In a normal situation. Right?
 Okay. Now, to get an abruption, you get a detachment of the placenta up here and you start developing basically a sac of blood in between the uterus and the placenta. And it is what they call a potential space that then fills with blood. Right?
 And I think as you told us the mom, it is usually maternal bleeding. Right?
 As I remember your theory was that this was likely maternal bleeding and then mom developed low blood pressure and then that caused the lack of perfusion to the baby.
 Okay. But mom losing is blood. Right?
 Sure, I understand. I understand. So here is, and let’s just take a quick look at what you identified for me a second ago when the jury was out, the standard diagrams of what a placental abruption can look like in a uterus. And what we have here, for example, on the, this illustration, by the way, there is three or three-and-a-half of them here, Frank Netter was a famous medical doctor who, actually I guess he went to medical school drawing rather than writing notes and people realized his talent and he became an —
 Okay. So Dr. Netter has written up these illustrations for us. They basically are showing us three different abruptions that are abruptions significant enough to cause injury to a baby. You don’t care about ones that are little tiny ones. Right?
 Well, you have got to lose enough blood
 But you don’t know the size of the abruption that would be, say the minimize size to cause injury?
 Okay. And actually a frequent sign of abruption is mom starts bleeding out of her vagina.
 The only way that you can get an abruption and not have the mom bleeding is if somehow, it is like in this upper right area where this blood is and that is squeezed into a space where the baby is blocking the passage outside, to the outside world?
 Well, either one. But the point is you have got to have a cork in the bottle to prevent the blood from —
 Okay. So we have no vaginal bleeding here. Right?
 We have no signs, no evidence of mom having low blood pressure.
 And we have no signs of mom having a low blood count before this baby was born, do we?
 Isn’t that a thing you would want to see?
 She has on, the only hematocrit that we have that is taken before the baby is born is right here. Now, she’s got, let’s look at the highlighted one. You see she’s got one on November 5th at 11:25 in the morning, and then right above that at 5 a.m. After the baby is born November 6th, she has another one. Right?
 So she has lost a little blood from the surgery, the C-section. Do you see that?
 So it is a little on the low side after the baby is born, you see she has got a hemoglobin of 11 and a hematocrit of 31.7. Right?
 And then we see the normal range being hemoglobin 12 to 16, hematocrit 36 to 46. By the way, just so we avoid confusion, these are adult norms, not baby norms.
 Right?
 Okay. So now we look at her hemoglobin, which is taken about an hour or so after the biophysical profile. It is in the normal range, right, 13?
 And her hematocrit is also in the normal range.
 Okay. Women often run lower hematocrits than men do. True?
 Okay. So this doesn’t give you any evidence that mom has enough bleeding to cause such a loss of her own blood perfusion that her baby would have suffered a massive injury like this.
 Speculation?
 Speculation, sir, isn’t it? I am just looking for an explanation.
 It is not an opinion that you can hold within a reasonable degree of probability because you didn’t look into what her normal hemoglobin or hematocrit was, did you?
 I am just trying to ask for what the real basis of the opinion is. So that is that one. Now, and by the way, a mom who is losing so much blood that she is losing perfusion to her baby, wouldn’t you expect her to faint or show some other signs of, you know, something serious going on?
 Sir, she was active all weekend long.
 No, we are talking about your theory of the prior weekend mom losing so much blood that she lost, that the baby lost blood flow. And yet we have a mother who by her testimony, her mother Pearlie testified, her husband testified, perfectly normal weekend, she is running around, nobody is feeling faint, nobody has got any problems.
 And you just don’t know.
 Now, here is my other question going back to my little diagram here. If we have an amniotic sac that is totally intact when the baby is born and then Dr. Terry opens it up and he sees grossly bloody fluid, not outside the sac, but inside the sac. Right?
 And we know the baby has been swallowing blood during the day of November 5th.
 So tell me, how does that blood in the placenta from outside here get into the intact amniotic cavity —
 — unless there has been a needle stick and then there has been bleeding caused inside the amniotic sac?
 Your assumption is. You have absolutely no —
 But you have also seen amniocentesis that, where the patient develops so much bleeding that they have to have an emergency delivery.
 Well, you know about it, don’t you?
 It does happen.
 But one thing missing from your whole line of testimony, because you told us you weren’t qualified, is the baby’s neurological cry for help, which namely the fetal heart tracings, are something you just don’t consider one way or the other because you are not qualified. Right?
 You know that the baby’s heart rate lost variability during the day.
 All right. Well, you are not convinced because you have no independent way to tell. Right?
 Well, actually couldn’t you also just look at the, what the nurses wrote and what Dr. Lambert and Dr. Badillo noted about poor variability, loss of variability? Did you see all of that in the record?
 Are you saying that Dr. Badillo and the nurses were wrong when they thought there was loss of variability in this baby?
 That is not your area.
 No, I am asking about the basis for an opinion that something had happened some prior day as opposed to on this very day.
 And I thought you said that everything was hunky-dory after the biophysical profile and therefore that is another reason why the bleeding must have been —
 Okay. Now, one more thing on this placental abruption thing. Assuming it happened, there is no way that this thing went away from the weekend of November 4th or 3rd, whatever, until delivery. It doesn’t happen that way, it doesn’t get reabsorbed or something to —
 So if she had a placental abruption on November 3rd or 4th, she would still have had it an November 5th?
 Have you seen pictures of abrupted placentas, have you seen an abrupted placenta itself?
 It is usually pretty obvious if it has been bad enough to cause enough bleeding that it hurts the baby.
 Remarkable, pretty obvious.
 Okay. Let me show you a quick picture. Tell me if this is kind of like the ones you have seen. This is Plaintiffs 3 marked for identification.
 What we are seeing on this is a large area over on the left side of this photograph of the placenta where it is kind of, well, you tell me.
 Old clotted blood. And it is dark and ugly?
 To use my layman’s expression.
 It doesn’t look healthy. We will leave that for now. Here is my other question. If she had
 Are we talking possibilities or probabilities?
 You don’t know enough about fetal heart rates to know whether a brain damaged baby can put out a heartbeat that looks absolutely normal with normal accelerations and normal variability, do you, sir?
 Flat line?
 Okay. But you don’t know any evidence that a baby can sustain a severe enough injury to have brain and kidney damage and yet somehow after that show a nice, bouncy, and variable and accelerative heartbeat?
 Is she?
 Of course, you have never met the child.
 Well, I guess that is something. But here is the other thing I wanted to ask you. She’s, you say it is your opinion that if she had this detachment or abruption over that prior weekend, it is still going to be there on November 5th. Right?
 Okay. And we know it is in what they call an anterior placenta, here is the belly, here is the feet down here, here is the mother’s head. Right?
 The doctor’s ultrasound wand is going right up here. Correct?
 And he is holding the wand, moving the wand around, Dr. Roberts was moving the wand around, looking for a pocket of fluid.
 If there had been a pocket of blood there, especially a large enough pocket of blood that it would have caused severe brain and kidney damage to a baby it should have been visible.
 That is my job.
 Especially if the placenta is down on the bottom of the uterus. Right?
 Okay. Well, didn’t it seem curious to you that we had in this case, even after Dr. Roberts did his ultrasound thing, we had what I guess in layman’s terms you could call a surveillance video that went on for half an hour or more of that mom’s placenta and uterus and everything inside. There were hundreds of images taken. There were 20 or so that had been preserved in the records, and yet there isn’t a single sign of anything detached in that placenta. Didn’t that seem odd to you?
 I thought you said you read Dr. Filly’s testimony.
 And he showed how the placenta is up here, the uterus is up here, and then all of the images he looked at absolutely no evidence of any placental abruption.
 So basically what you are postulating is a huge but invisible injury.
 All of this grossly bloody fluid in here and the baby swallowing the blood and vomiting up the blood, that is just coincidence? That is from the amnio that it is coincidence?
 How did it get into the amniotic cavity without breaking the membrane?
 But we had intact membranes at birth according to Dr. Terry.
 Right. That is not your area of
 Did you ever wonder, Dr. Christmas, why your phone never rings from plaintiffs’ lawyers?
 It didn’t possibly cross your mind that you were one of those guys who could always be counted on if there is any issue where it might be a little bit of ambiguity that you would slice it for the healthcare provider? That didn’t ever occur to you?
 Let’s talk about choices for the patient. I thought you had told us in your deposition that in terms of making a recommendation for Marsha Simpson of do we go to early delivery preceded by an amnio or not, you would have been on the fence for her.
 Well, let me quote you exactly what you said.
 “In regards to Marsha Simpson, if I am correctly interpreting what you are saying to me, it is that you don’t have enough information because you are unable to examine the patient to tell me what you would have recommended to her as a course of treatment. Is that a fair characterization?”
 Okay. Now, my point, though, is you don’t know what you would have necessarily recommended for her, and the point is you would have given her some choices.
 What I got from those two quotes, putting them together, and you correct me if I am wrong, is that studying her records there is no clear cut, Man, she needs to go straight to early induction preceded by amnio. At least that is my —
 Okay. Options, there are options.
 No, no, we are not talking about that. We are talking about having a dialogue with a patient and giving the patient the information so the patient can make an intelligent choice. Isn’t that what medical standards require in the Commonwealth of Virginia?
 To —
 Only to a certain degree?
 Well, let me show you how I had put it earlier, how one of the other experts had put it earlier.
 “If there are reasonable options, the obstetrician must inform the patient so the patient can make an intelligent choice.”
 Reasonable options, you —
 Okay. So, because it is the patient’s choice, it is the patient’s life, they are the ones that have to live with it. Right?
 Okay. And so, you had told us also in your deposition, that if, let me back up a second. You showed us the informed consent form or Mr. Batten did, showed us the informed consent form. She signed it.
 I want you to plug in one additional fact, that the patient read the form and signed it because she had not been presented any options and she thought the amnio was a test that she had to have. Are you willing to assume that?
 Hypothetically and in this case because she testified to this, and you can’t judge credibility one way or the other, can you?
 Right. And plenty of patients —
 Sure. And plenty of patients think they understand because they trust their doctor —
 I am asking you a question.
 I am trying to ask you a question, sir.
 Isn’t it true that plenty of patients trust doctors enough that they assume that the doctor is going to give them the options if there are options.
 Well, we will let the jury judge that, then. The point is didn’t you also tell us in your deposition that if there had been no presentation of options, amnio versus —
 — expectant management, and by the way, expectant management, watchful waiting —
 — would have been a reasonable option for this patient?
 We don’t get to quote Dr. Roberts.
 So the point is that didn’t you also tell us that if the two options of watchful waiting versus straight to amnio, do not pass go and then we will have an elected induction had not been presented to this patient, that would violate the Virginia standard of care?
 You did say that and you stand by that testimony?
 Okay. So that is just an issue that the jury is going to have to decide who is right on this. If Dr. Roberts just told her, This is what we are going to do, I am going to do, I am going to put you to early induction and I am going to test the lungs ahead of time, and he didn’t give her options, that would be wrong and that would violate the standard of care if that is what they conclude. True?
 Okay. And similarly, let’s talk about another critical choice time. 10:30 A.m., mom has had her biophysical profile. It has come back 4 out of 8. By the way, just one tiny little segue here, that business about the fetal breathing, the quote you were reading from talked about loss of variability and fetal breathing being the first to go.
 Let’s just look at the quote to make sure we have it right.
 This was your man Callen, totally reliable authority. Right?
 “Data have demonstrated in fetal acidemia,” that is the acidosis we are talking about, “The first biophysical activities to become compromised are fetal heart rate, reactivity, and fetal breathing.”
 I thought you said fetal breathing, but —
 In this case, this patient had lost at least some, and maybe not all the time, had lost fetal heart rate reactivity, didn’t she?
 Actually, you know, there is this thing called an abbreviated biophysical profile. Right? You are familiar with it?
 And the abbreviated one uses two things: It uses amniotic fluid and fetal heart rate. True?
 Okay. But there are others that say, just like I said, which is if you want to go with a couple of things —
 Right. And Dr. Terry thought she didn’t pass the nonstress test at 9:20. That is why he ordered the biophysical profile. Right?
 Was he wrong?
 Okay. But now we reach the decision point at 10:30 in the morning.
 And there were two reasonable options then, weren’t there, sir?
 Reasonable options, let’s stick with reasonable options.
 Actually, let me just back up a second. I thought I wrote down — and I wrote a bunch of little notes here — I thought I wrote down that one thing you said on direct examination that at 10:30 A.m. a Cesarean section was, quote, absolutely not indicated.
 Okay. Now you are totally changing your deposition testimony. Do you have your transcript there?
 Look at page 90.
 Yes, sir.
 I am sorry. “What were the treatment options for Marsha Simpson and her fetus following the biophysical profile?” Answer, “The treatment options were” —
 Are you there? “The treatment options were to do nothing, which I think would have been totally inappropriate, to deliver her at that point by Cesarean section, to deliver her by induction of labor, or to monitor her in an open-ended fashion without a plan for delivery.”
 Question, “So if I am interpreting what you have been telling me, Doctor, the viable, the best treatment options were either delivery through induction or delivery through Cesarean section?”
 No, sir. No, sir.
 Okay.
 I asked you would it have been a reasonable option.
 I thought you said —
 Let’s not quibble with each other. You said right here that the best treatment options were either delivery through induction or delivery through Cesarean section. Answer, “That is my opinion.”
 So those —
 A reasonable —
 You are just an arguer.
 Let me state my question, sir.
 So if the two, if the best treatment options were either delivery through induction or through C-section at 10:30 in the morning, the patient deserved to know that.
 I didn’t ask that. I asked if the patient deserved to know.
 I thought you told us somewhere in your deposition that somebody needed to, whoever it was, somebody needed to tell this patient, Marsha Simpson, “We have options here and here is what they are” at 10:30 in the morning.
 Well, here is a way you can do it. If you just tell the patient: We are going to induce labor, Mrs. Simpson. Hi, I am Dr. Lambert.
 Okay. If that is the only way it happened, and she wasn’t offered the option, well, let me put it this way, 10:30 in the morning or 11, in that timeframe: Mrs. Simpson, we have had this biophysical profile, the score is 4 out of 10. You know, there are some things going on here. Some people might think, and there are two options, we can go for an induction, although your cervix isn’t very ripe and everything. Or we can go for an immediate C-section if that is what you would like to do. That is something that should have been —
 Let me finish my sentence and then you get to finish your answer. That is something that should have been presented to this patient.
 Or some way, some way —
 Well, I am asking you.
 Okay. So your —
 Because, of course, nobody lined those up for her, did they?
 Yes. By the way, that list that Mr. Batten was reading from about all of the risks of C-section and whatnot, that didn’t say one word about the baby, did it?
 Well, let’s take a look at it.
 The answer that you gave about all of the risks of C-section, like blood clots in the mother’s leg and wound infection and stuff like that, none of those were counterbalanced by you in your testimony to say, Well, what about the baby? You didn’t consider that when you were talking about the risk of C-section.
 It can’t happen and meet the standard of care is what you are trying to say.
 Okay. Let me ask you —
 It sounds like we are going to get another talk. Can I just ask my next question?
 Have you ever known a patient who is in pain, severe pain, what someone could assume the lady is in severe pain from, cramping pain from something going on inside her uterus, she can’t tell. And she is presented the option now that there are some parameters that don’t look so good on this baby. We could induce you, we could do an immediate C-section just to make sure that the baby is okay. Most mothers —
 Please, sir, I will finish my question if you don’t mind. Most mothers presented the option of taking risks on themselves versus making absolutely 100 percent sure that we get a good safe baby out now will go for the baby.
 What I am trying to say is they will opt for taking risks on themselves if they think that they will, that they can be reducing risks to their baby.
 I am not asking you —
 I never said, I don’t think I said guarantee.
 What I am trying to say is there is a chance there is something wrong with the baby, it could hurt you if we did a C-section, you know, you would get an infection, blah, blah, blah, blah. Do we want to opt on the side of going for the baby now and getting whatever the best baby we can get right now?
 And then to communicate —
 Okay. All right. Let me go to two other quick topics and then we are done. You told us something about Dr. Roberts obtaining dark blood.
 No, Dr. Roberts, the amnio doctor.
 He obtained dark blood. It is not in the amnio record. You know that of course.
 Trust me on that. But here is the question. If, if he got dark blood, that is something that needs to be moved on right then and there.
 That is what you told me in your deposition.
 All right. Let’s take a look. Hang on a second.
 Thirty-four and 35?
 Question, “Have you ever discovered old blood doing an amniocentesis?”
 Well, forgive my hyperbole. Maybe you said, “Oh, yeah.” “Oh yeah.”
 And by the way —
 Question, “Let’s assume that the fetus is viable.”
 Okay. So dark blood, if obtained, is something that should have been communicated to the hand-off doctor because it could be a sign something is wrong, we need to move on this baby.
 But we are leaving out a fact here, sir.
 It has some relevance.
 By the way, this base excess thing you were talking about, if the base excess is, and you know base excess has to be calculated with hemoglobin plugged in.
 Okay. So if the base excess hadn’t had hemoglobin plugged into it, and it turned out it was not plus 7 but was minus 11, it would be right —
 Minus 12, minus 11, you are within the range?
 That is not the way it works in medicine, is it, sir? 98.6 degree temperature —
 Are you —
 Are you familiar with this statistical concept of standard deviations?
 That means there is no absolute firm number, for example, like 98 —
 We have, there is a bell curve, we have ranges.
 Then I guess the final point, and this is a small one, but this sinusoidal-like pattern that we were talking about, you know Dr. Boehm and he is a —
 Okay. You know he is one of the other expert witnesses for them?
 Did you see his article on intermittent sinusoidal fetal heart rate, the clinical significance of it?
 Okay. You wouldn’t doubt that it is reliable authority if he wrote it and he is chosen to be the expert here, would you?
 Well, let me just put it this way. Is it possible that you can get intermittent sinusoidal type of patterns and that that can be an indication that the baby is anemic?
 But if Dr. Boehm had written about it that way, you wouldn’t have any way to dispute it?
 Sure.
 It was actually ultimately 8 once it got down.
 The point though, sir, is that you can get intermittent sinusoidal patterns. That is the point of the article.
 His conclusion, this suggests that intermittent sinusoidal fetal heart rate may occur earlier in deterioration and that a continuous sinusoidal pattern appears only in severe stress in which the fetus has lost total autonomic control. Do you disagree with that?
 Okay. Fair enough. A tiny point, but the blood gas of 7.24, did you say that you thought it was a cord blood gas or not?
 Well, not exactly, it was 45 minutes after they had a bunch of oxygen.
 And if you want to talk about your rigid criteria, you know, 11 doesn’t count but 12 does count, well, they say it has got to be cord blood gas, don’t they?
 Okay. So if you are going to be rigid now —
 Okay, that is very fine. I thank you very much. I think is all I have.
 Doctor, you make a major part of your income every year testifying in cases like this, don’t you?
 Is a third a major part?
 But the fact of the matter is, Doctor, that one third – 33 percent of your income comes from reviewing medical cases, doing depositions, and testifying in court, right?
 And that one third isn’t a major issue to you?
 All right. And you charge, Doctor, $500 an hour for the time that you spend reviewing records and films, true?
 And you charge $750 an hour to come and testify in court or at a deposition, don’t you?
 Have you ever testified to that, Doctor?
 Have you ever testified that you charge $750 an hour for trial as well?
 There is a lot of testimony of yours out there, isn’t there Doctor?
 You have been doing this kind of work since 1991, right?
 And every year do you more and more of it, don’t you?
 All right. So was there a time when you actually made more than a third of your income doing this?
 Well as recently as February you testified that it was a third of your income, right? February of this year?
 Do you recall testifying in a case in Maryland called Heras versus Stimpson, and you gave a deposition?
 Is that you, Gordon Sze?
 And you were asked “What are your charges for review, deposition, and trial?” And you said “$500 an hour.”
 Was that your testimony under oath, Doctor?
 Mr. Pistorius, let us just carry on and take you up on your last answer. You have a good memory of what happened until the time you fired the shots?
 And thereafter your memory is not that good.
 When you, you’ve got your gun. You had to bend down and get it from under the bed?
 You are looking back at the passage and you now, you got your gun and what did you do?
 And your intention was to?
 And what was your intention when you made your way to the–
 You see, on your version, Mr. Pistorius, if you cared about Reeva, you would have made sure that she hears you, that she’s there. You didn’t.
 That is why you changed your 1-1-5?
 That’s why, in your plea explanation you said that you spoke to her, but not in your bail application. Am I right?
 So why did you not say that in your bail application?
 In your, when you prepared for court, you wanted the Court to understand that you knew she was on the bed. That’s why you invented a discussion with her.
 During your bail application, you did not think that there would be a need to invent a discussion. Isn’t that so?
 You see, Mr. Pistorius, the nature of the discussion before you got up was such that at least you thought that she was awake.
 What I don’t understand is why you wouldn’t make sure that Reeva was fine before you storm off.
 It’s because it’s not the truth, Mr. Pistorius. That’s why it’s difficult to explain why you did not see if she was fine. Isn’t that so?
 You see in this method we had two couples give evidence. The Stipps gave evidence. The first thing that happened between them is they spoke to each other. “Did you hear that? What was that?” The same with the Johnsons. Johnson and Byrd. When something happened, they conversed. But you didn’t.
 Why?
 You were right next to her. You were right next to her in a situation of danger. But you did not take the time to talk to Reeva.
 When you got your gun, you were right next to her. If she was in the room.
 I say, Mr. Pistorius, a reasonable person would have looked where Reeva was, looked if she was safe, and if she panicked. But you didn’t. You just grabbed a gun. On your own version, not my version, on your own version, you did not find out if she was OK or scared or [unintelligible]. Am I right?
 Ok, let’s stop.
 You never established if she was scared?
 You never established if she heard you?
 If she heard the danger.
 You wanted to arm yourself.
 That’s the first thought that went through your mind.
 That’s not true. I mean, if, if you spoke to Reeva, the two of you could have taken lots of other steps. Am I right?
 You see, that’s what you say. You’re saying there was no time. You heard something in the bathroom. You and Reeva in the bedroom.
 There’s a passage leading between the bedroom and the bathroom.
 You could have done lots of other things.
 You could have, let’s agree that, arming yourself, you and her could have both gone onto the balcony?
 But it is a possibility?
 You could have both hid behind the bed.
 You both could’ve been on her side of the bed, with your view on the passage.
 You see, Mister, you know it’s my view that your version is not correct. And it’s improbable that you would act in that way but let’s take it one step further. When you armed yourself, you rushed towards the area of the passage?
 And then you entered the passage?
 Ready to shoot.
 What, then? Were you not ready to shoot?
 But why would you go, arm yourself, rush toward the danger, if you’re not ready to shoot? That’s not true. Not on your version, either.
 It’s not that easy. You cannot tell the court I didn’t think. You armed yourself and I am sure you released the safety mechanism on your gun.
 So you did that. You got your gun, released the safety mechanism. Why?
 And that’s why you stormed. You wanted to shoot.
 Ready to shoot, if you saw something you would have just pulled the trigger. Am I wrong?
 No, but what was your intention? I’m walking down the passage. I want to protect Reeva. You would have fired a shot.
 And if you saw somebody?
 What were you ready to do?
 You were. You armed yourself. You’re ready to shoot.
 You see again, Mr. Pistorius, you say I wasn’t ready to take somebody’s life, you’re arguing. Just think of the questions. Walking down the passage, you had your gun. The safety was disengaged. You were ready to shoot.
 You wanted to shoot. If you saw somebody you wanted to shoot.
 The difference is that you were ready to shoot. If somebody moved you would have fired?
 If you saw somebody in that passage, what then?
 Walking down the passage, gun in hand, if you saw somebody, you would have fired?
 But remember, you remember so much detail. You know when you walked slow. You know when you walked a bit faster. You know when you walked really fast. Now I’m asking you to tell the court, when you walked down that passage, the gun was pointing towards the bathroom.
 Any movement, you would have fired.
 And then you started screaming?
 Oh. Tell me then, at what point—you see, it’s interesting. You remember the detail so well that you correct me. And I just want you to remember. Now, when did you start screaming?
 What did you shout and scream?
 And there was no response from Reeva?
 At that time your intention is to go towards the danger.
 You’re vulnerable, but you go towards the danger?
 Why would you do that?
 Nobody would have been in danger because there was no intruder. That’s the fact of this matter.
 I know that’s what you’re trying to say but the fact of this matter is that if you had stayed in that room, Reeva would have been alive. Those are the facts. I’m testing you on a version that’s not true.
 You see my problem is the following. You said you were vulnerable. You felt vulnerable. Am I right?
 But you approached the danger. The two doesn’t make sense. You can’t be vulnerable and approach the danger.
 Reeva was the one person that you didn’t even talk to. So you can’t bring her into this. You didn’t even talk to her.
 Well, there wasn’t a conversation. Let me rephrase that. I’m sorry. You didn’t even make sure that she was there, and that she heard you before you left.
 What I don’t understand, Mr. Pistorius, is, and I’m just testing your version, because as far as I’m concerned, it’s not true. If you had remained in your bedroom you had a clear view of the passage.
 But, right around the corner you could peep down the passage with a clear view of the bed.
 So that would put you in a position where somebody coming out of the bathroom had to walk at least 5 meters to get to you.
 And you would be able to see them.
 But you rushed towards the danger.
 You walked towards the danger.
 Why would you do that?
 You know, when you just said, “I’m not sure,” that indicates the probability of your version, because nobody would be sure why you did it. It doesn’t make sense.
 And you agree by saying, “I’m not sure.” I’m not sure why I did it.
 You see, I find your instinct strange. I find your instinct strange for the following two reasons. One, instinct would have made sure Reeva is safe. That was never instinct, to make sure she’s safe. Am I right?
 So, your instinct wasn’t to make sure she’s safe.
 We will go through this. You gave the court unbelievable detail about thought processes in your evidence. Where you walked slowly, where you walked faster, where you shouted. And I’m testing your thought processes because you put yourself out there.
 Why did you approach the danger?
 And you and Reeva could have gone out the main bedroom door.
 Why did you not do that?
 That is the one thing in this case, Mr. Pistorius, that you cannot explain. Not on your version. Why did you not leave through your bedroom door?
 Is that your reason why you did not leave through the main bedroom door?
 Then give us a reason. You went past the bedroom door. You two could have left through that main bedroom door to safety.
 It’s easy to think of a version why you killed Reeva and to come up with an innocent reason, that’s also easy. But the defects are that the door, the bedroom door, was the closest escape there was.
 Mr. Pistorius, you have to come up with a version to put Reeva in the bathroom to explain why you went to the bathroom. Your whole version is to explain why you got to the bathroom innocently. That’s why the one major issue of the bedroom door you cannot explain. Explain that. You have to tell the court why you didn’t take Reeva out that bedroom window to safety—out the bedroom door.
 You see, you did the opposite. You approached the danger. That doesn’t make sense. It’s not true.
 So you wanted to go confront them, that’s me, Oscar. I wanted to go confront them?
 Stand up for myself.
 If I see them I’ll shoot them.
 But isn’t that the inference? I wanted to go confront these robbers.
 And you did, by firing.
 You walked down the passage, your intention is to go confront the intruders.
 Now if that is true, finish up now, I’ll give you an opportunity—
 Now you see, let us just take it slowly, you knew your bathroom very well. You know what it looked like, how big the toilet is, in the bathroom, how where the shower is, you knew it well, am I right?
 You knew the only way into your house through the bathroom is down that passage? From the bathroom [bedroom]?
 If you’re in the bathroom, to get from the bathroom to the house, the only way to do that is to walk down the– .
 Yes.
 Let me try again. For an intruder that gained entry through your bathroom, if you take that as a fact, to get to your bedroom he must walk down the passage.
 That is the passage that you could control from your bedroom?
 But you didn’t.
 When you shouted and screamed you said you shouted for them to leave and for Reeva to phone the police.
 You got no response from Reeva?
 Now, do you think…do you think it was loud, the screams?
 Shouting at Reeva?
 And she never responded?
 And I’ll ask it more. She never responded?
 Then you got to the entrance of the bathroom?
 And you kept quiet?
 The reason being?
 Okay, so this wasn’t split second. Now we’re thinking, now you’re thinking, and you are kneeling down and your gun is facing towards the bathroom?
 That’s why it doesn’t make sense that you approached them. You’re right. Thinking of your version that’s true, but you approached them.
 That is not true Mr. Pistorius, nobody would do that. Nobody would do that. It’s a lie.
 Just before you get to the far area of the bathroom what happened then?
 Yes? Then?
 No, no, wait, you’re going too quickly now. We’re going way too quickly now. I just want to get the sequence. You, in that passage, you screamed and shouted.
 Then, close to the entrance where the tiles start, that’s where you kept quiet.
 Yeah, what you were doing.
 When did you hear a door shut?
 So it was in the passage. You heard a door slam.
 And the only door that could be could have been the toilet?
 So what did you think?
 That long argument of 100% sure, that’s what you thought, because it never happened. There was nobody that had accessed that window on that night.
 Now, when you entered the bathroom you said you saw that the window was open.
 So there was enough light for you to see the window.
 But why did you say there wasn’t enough light and then you said there were?
 Ok, now, you saw that the window was open. What happened then?
 But, before we go on, you, one thing we know is at that stage you looked in the bathroom and you were clear in your mind that there was no one in the bathroom.
 That you established. There’s no one in the bathroom. And you saw that the toilet door was closed?
 You could see that.
 Now, that door was usually open? Or not?
 The toilet door, was that usually open? Or not?
 Was that strange that it was closed? Or did that not make a difference?
 You either heard someone kick the door or slam it close, but the fact that it was closed, was that, in itself, strange?
 You know, you said so. You said one of two things. Either it was slammed closed or somebody kicked the door.
 Well, you see, why are you making these mistakes? Because the fact that you’re making them is significant. Why are you making this mistake?
 Mr. Pistorius, you said, “I never, ever said that somebody kicked the door.”
 You see, you can’t just make mis—give contradictory versions and then apologize. There’s a reason for it. What is the reason why you are doing it?
 No, it can’t be a mistake. It must be I am thinking of something that never happened and I have to keep up. That’s it. Your version never happened and you have to keep up with an untruth. That’s why you’re making these mistakes. Isn’t that so?
 Why would you make a mistake about somebody kicking the door? I want to know why?
 You have to be sure. You made it.
 No.
 OK, one more time then I’m moving on. It’s not the mistake. It’s you saying, “I never, ever said somebody kicked the door.” That is, for me, what it’s about, not the fact that you made a mistake. That you were so convinced that you never said it.
 As convinced as you are about the rest of your evidence, that is my problem.
 I am putting it to you that your mistakes are as convincing as your evidence in the way you deliver it. And that’s a problem. Do you want to comment on it?
 Now the door is closed, you know how big that door is inside? How small it is?
 It has been re-constructed here, that’s on scale. That’s exactly how big the toilet is behind me.
 But you know that if someone’s there they’ve got limited space to move, is that right?
 If there’s a ladder at the window they could go down a ladder if they get through the window.
 Or come through the door.
 Now, I have to test you on this. You want to tell the Court that you reasonably thought an intruder came through your window and walked into your toilet and close the door? Why would an intruder do that? Is that what you thought?
 Are you saying that it’s reasonable for any person to think that an intruder would come through the window into the toilet and close the door?
 If there was an intruder, do you think he would go into a toilet and close the door?
 Now you’re standing there, you, Mr. Oscar Pistorius standing there, thinking he came through that window, he went into that toilet. That’s what you thought.
 No, it is so far fetched that it would happen, Mr. Pistorius. It’s improbable that you would even think that an intruder would run into my toilet and lock the door. And close it.
 I just want to consider. Let us use that word. You know what you considered? You considered where you had to walk slowly where you had to be quiet. You had to consider to walk slowly beyond the passage, keeping your attention to the danger.
 You had to consider when to be quiet.
 But considering as far as—
 You want to say that. We are testing it. Time, time, time is something that you’ve said and we are testing it.
 Just listen to my questions. You’ve considered that it’s now time to be quiet. It’s something that you considered and followed. And did. Am I right?
 You had to consider and reason to be quiet. I know you want to give your version. And we’ll get there. You considered and you reasoned that it’s now time to be quiet.
 I asked you what, exactly. We’re testing your thought methods. Because if you want to say, now, we’re testing your thought methods, so just follow me.
 I’ll try. You thought that it’s better to be quiet when you got to the tiled area of the bathroom.
 And you thought it’s better to be quiet why?
 Then you thought I must be careful when I go into the bathroom? Am I right?
 And you thought, make sure there’s nobody in the bathroom, and you did. There’s nobody there.
 Or to make sure there is someone I have to shoot at, but something I have to do when you got to the bathroom.
 Now, if you did not go there to shoot someone, what did you want to do then?
 OK, let us just work on that. You intention was to make the person flee?
 Nothing else.
 And when you got into the bathroom, there was nobody there.
 What happened then?
 Just one moment. Of your whole version, Mr. Pistorius, this is the most improbable. Reeva at that stage is 3 meters away from you in the toilet?
 No, no. In fact, I’m talking about the facts, at that stage, when you shouted and screamed for Reeva to phone the police, she is 3 meters away from you in a toilet.
 And she never uttered a word.
 It’s not possible. It’s not probable. She would be scared. She would shout out and talk to you. You are in the same room.
 Because you’re in the room, sir. Mr. Pistorius, you’re now in the room, you’re shouting, she’s 3 meters away from you behind that particular door. There is no way that you’ll convince a court that she stood there saying nothing. Why? Why would she not say a thing?
 It is not true. The only reason is that it’s not true, Mr. Pistorius. She would have responded.
 Yes.
 You see, and we’ll take it through, I see there’s 15 minutes left, in fact she is standing, on your version and on the state’s version, she’s standing facing behind the door facing the bathroom, facing you that’s shouting.
 Now if she was scared she would have not have been there. She would have hid somewhere in the toilet.
 I can, Mr. Pistorius, I think the state can. She was talking to you, she was standing right in front of you by the toilet door talking to you when you shot her.
 That’s the only reasonable explanation for her standing upright. That’s the only reasonable explanation why you shot her in the head. The way you did.
 She wasn’t scared of anything. Except you. She wasn’t scared of an intruder. She was scared of you.
 Mr. Pistorius, on the probabilities, I am looking at the door, you don’t have to. If bullet hole A hit her on the right hand side, in her right hip, she’s standing facing you.
 Now if she was scared, if your version was true, she would not have been in front of the door facing you.
 If she thought you were retreating, that gives her more reason to talk. To say, you’re coming to me, come, I’ll phone the police. What’s wrong, Oscar? Never.
 You see, Mr. Pistorius, she’s awake, she’s in a toilet, you’re shouting, you are screaming. You are 3 meters from her, she would have responded. She would not have been quiet, Mr. Pistorius.
 Did she scream at all whilst you shot her four times?
 Are you sure? Are you sure, Mr. Pistorius, that Reeva did not scream after the first shot? Are you, Mr. Pistorius?
 My lady, I am giving the witness time to console himself. He’s distressed. I’ll wait a minute.
 Just answer my question. After the first shot, did she scream?
 Are you sure?
 Would you have heard her?
 That’s why I’m asking you the question. How can you exclude the fact she was screaming if you couldn’t hear?
 No, you said, Mr. Pistorius, she never screamed. You couldn’t hear. You’re just saying that.
 No, that’s not what you’re saying. You’re saying she didn’t scream. And that’s why I tested you on it.
 You see, that’s why I’m asking you the questions. People heard a woman scream during the shots. Is that possible?
 Why?
 No, you can’t say that.
 No you can’t. That’s your version, but that’s not something that you can with conviction say to the Court, that nobody screamed, during the shots. Can you?
 No you can’t. How can you? You just said you can’t. How can you say that nobody screamed during the shots?
 How can you say that? How can you say that?
 I think you’re making a mistake again. The mistake is you forgot about your ears ringing.
 No, I’m talking about the shooting. You can’t get away with that every time. You don’t know what I’m talking about. Sometimes you have to take responsibility. I said during the shooting, Mr. Pistorius. You cannot have understood me wrongly.
 During the shots, Mr. Pistorius, you cannot get away with this time and time again, pretending that you couldn’t follow.
 Now let’s—it’s on record and I’ll argue it. Can you say that Reeva didn’t scream after the first shot?
 You know what, it was put in in your bail application that nobody but you screamed on that night.
 Look at it, the way I remember it is that there was no woman screaming. That was what was put in the bail application. I’ve marked it on mine, my lady. I’ll carry on on this when we get back and I have the record. I will do that.
 Mr. Pistorius, now you see, I’ve heard your evidence on how it affected you and how you felt. Will you agree with me that for Reeva being in that small cubicle, when four shots were fired through the door, must have been horrific.
 For Reeva, being in that small cubicle when four shots were fired through the door, must have been horrific.
 What happened to her that night was unthinkable. I never heard you say anything about how she must have reacted in that toilet. Thinking of it. Because that’s the crux of this case. Have you?
 Let us deal with it, you are standing in the bathroom, you’re now shouting and screaming at Reeva, what happened?
 No, before the shooting.
 What noise?
 Wood moving?
 Is that all you heard? Wood moving?
 No, you see, there we go. There we go. Not once did you say I heard the door open. It’s the first word today that you would say. I heard the door. You perceived lots of things. But it’s not in the record that you heard the door opening. Why now today?
 What did you hear?
 You thought you heard the door opening. But did you also think you heard wood moving?
 You stood there, and you had your eyes on the door. And the window.
 But you pointed the gun at the door.
 What happened then?
 But first you thought you heard something. What did you hear?
 You heard a noise and you thought, somebody is coming out to attack me. Nothing else.
 But, thinking back, that could have been anything. Why would you think someone is coming out to attack you?
 That’s a lie, Mr. Pistorius.
 No, you do. You standing there. You facing the door. Why would you think somebody was attacking you?
 You see, the hearing of a noise and the perception of an attack is two different things. Why do you think somebody wanted to attack you?
 No, you see, the two doesn’t make sense. The fact that you hear a noise, and the fact that you think the door was opening, those two is not the same thing. It is not the same thing. And your perception is impossible, Mr. Pistorius. You never perceived somebody coming after you. Am I right?
 In fact you knew that Reeva was behind the door. And you shot at her. That is the only thing that makes sense. You shot at her, knowing that she’s behind that door.
